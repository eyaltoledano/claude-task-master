Update the description, details, and test strategy to reflect the new information\n4. Do not change anything unnecessarily - just adapt what needs to change based on the prompt\n5.

For tasks with completed subtasks, build upon what has already been done rather than rewriting everything\n8. If an existing completed subtask needs to be changed/undone based on the new context, DO NOT modify it directly\n9. Instead, add a new subtask that clearly indicates what needs to be changed or replaced\n10. Use the existence of completed subtasks as an opportunity to make new subtasks more specific and targeted\n11. Ensure any new subtasks have unique IDs that don't conflict with existing ones\n12. CRITICAL: For subtask IDs, use ONLY numeric values (1, 2, 3, etc.) NOT strings (\"1\", \"2\", \"3\")\n13. CRITICAL: Subtask IDs should start from 1 and increment sequentially (1, 2, 3...) - do NOT use parent task ID as prefix\n\nThe changes described in the prompt should be thoughtfully applied to make the task more accurate and actionable.",
