# Task Master <Icon icon="ListChecks" />

Task Master is an AI-powered task management system designed to streamline your development workflow, especially when working with AI assistants like Claude within environments like Cursor.

## <Icon icon="Key" /> Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Anthropic API Key:** Essential for Claude integration.
- **Perplexity API Key (Optional):** Required if you plan to use the `--research` features via the OpenAI SDK integration.

<Info>
  **API Keys are Crucial:** Task Master relies heavily on AI models. You'll need to configure your API keys, typically via environment variables or the MCP server setup, for the system to function correctly.
</Info>

## <Icon icon="Rocket" /> Quick Start

Get up and running with Task Master using one of the following methods:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Option 1: MCP (Recommended)">

### Option 1 | MCP (Recommended) <Icon icon="Server" />

Using the Model Control Protocol (MCP) within your editor (like Cursor) is the easiest and recommended way to integrate Task Master.

<Steps>
<Step title="Configure MCP Server">
Add the `taskmaster-ai` configuration to your editor's MCP settings (e.g., `settings.json` in VS Code/Cursor). Replace placeholders with your actual API keys.

```json {{ title="Editor MCP Configuration" }}
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"taskmaster-ai": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "--package=task-master-ai", "task-master-ai", "mcp-server"], // Ensure mcp-server command is included if needed
			"env": {
				"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE",
				"PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "YOUR_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY_HERE", // Optional but recommended
				"MODEL": "claude-3-haiku-20240307", // Example: Or Opus/Sonnet
				"PERPLEXITY_MODEL": "sonar-medium-online", // Example
				"MAX_TOKENS": "4096", // Adjust as needed
				"TEMPERATURE": "0.2",
				"DEFAULT_SUBTASKS": "5",
				"DEFAULT_PRIORITY": "medium",
				"LOG_LEVEL": "info" // Set to 'debug' for more verbose logging
			}
		}
	}
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Enable MCP">
Activate or enable the MCP server within your editor according to its specific instructions.
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize Task Master">
Prompt your AI assistant (e.g., within Cursor) to set up the project:

```prompt {{ title="Initialization Prompt" }}
Can you please initialize taskmaster-ai in my project?
```
</Step>
<Step title="Interact via AI">
Use natural language commands with your AI assistant to manage tasks:

```prompt {{ title="Example Prompts" }}
Can you parse my PRD at scripts/prd.txt?
What's the next task I should work on?
Can you help me implement task 3?
Can you help me expand task 4?
List all pending tasks.
Set task 5 to done.
```
</Step>
</Steps>
</Tab>

<Tab title="Option 2: Command Line">

### Option 2: Using Command Line <Icon icon="TerminalSquare" />

You can also install and use Task Master directly from your terminal.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install Task Master">
Install the package either globally or locally within your project.

<CodeBlockGroup>

```bash {{ title="Global Install" }}
npm install -g task-master-ai
```

```bash {{ title="Local Install" }}
npm install task-master-ai
# or
npm install --save-dev task-master-ai
```

</CodeBlockGroup>
<Info>Ensure your environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.) are set or use a `.env` file in your project root.</Info>
</Step>
<Step title="Initialize Project">
Run the `init` command to set up the project structure.

<CodeBlockGroup>

```bash {{ title="Global Usage" }}
task-master init
```

```bash {{ title="Local Usage (npx)" }}
npx task-master init
```
</CodeBlockGroup>
This interactive command will guide you through setting up project details. Add the `-y` flag to use defaults.
</Step>
<Step title="Use Common Commands">
Execute commands directly in your terminal.

```bash {{ title="Common CLI Commands" }}
# Initialize a new project (if not done yet)
task-master init -y

# Parse a PRD and generate tasks
task-master parse-prd path/to/your-prd.txt

# List all tasks
task-master list

# Show the next task to work on
task-master next

# Show details for a specific task (e.g., task 5)
task-master show 5

# Generate individual task Markdown files
task-master generate
```
See the full command reference for more options.

## <Icon icon="Bug" /> Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, particularly with the `init` command:

<Accordion title="If 'task-master init' seems unresponsive">
  Sometimes, path or execution issues can occur. Try running the initialization script directly using Node:

  **1. Using Local Installation:**
  ```bash
  node node_modules/task-master-ai/scripts/init.js
  ```
  *(Adjust path if installed under a different scope or location)*

  **2. Using Cloned Repository:**
  If you cloned the repository directly:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master.git
  cd claude-task-master
  npm install # Install dependencies if needed
  node scripts/init.js
  ```
</Accordion>

<Tip>Enable debug logging by setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `debug` for more detailed output.</Tip>
