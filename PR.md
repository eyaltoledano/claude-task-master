# Implement PRD Generation Workflow 

## Overview
This PR implements a complete PRD generation workflow as discussed in issue #37. The workflow provides a structured approach to transform raw ideas into comprehensive Product Requirement Documents through an AI-assisted process.

## Features Added
1. **Complete PRD Generation Workflow**:
   - `ideate`: Convert raw ideas into structured product concepts
   - `round-table`: Simulate expert discussions to refine concepts
   - `refine-concept`: Apply expert feedback to improve concepts
   - `generate-prd-file`: Create formal PRD documents
   - Seamless integration with existing `parse-prd` command

2. **API Improvements**:
   - Added `callAnthropicApi` function for streaming API responses
   - Enhanced error handling for API connectivity issues
   - Added debug logging for troubleshooting

3. **Cross-Platform Support**:
   - Workarounds for PowerShell command line limitations
   - Batch file examples for Windows users
   - Shell script template for Linux/macOS users
   - Comprehensive troubleshooting guide

4. **Documentation**:
   - Updated README with detailed usage instructions
   - Step-by-step guides for Windows and Linux users
   - Updated CHANGELOG with version 0.9.30 entries

## Testing
The implementation has been tested on:
- Windows 10 with PowerShell
- The workflow successfully generates a complete PRD from a raw idea
- All intermediate files (concept, discussion, refined concept) are properly created
- The final PRD is correctly parsed into tasks

## Implementation Notes
- PowerShell users may encounter command line length limitations, which are addressed with batch file workarounds
- The `.env` file should contain the Anthropic API key for authentication
- The workflow is designed to be modular, allowing users to run individual steps or the complete process

## Files Not Included
During development and testing, several temporary files were created but deliberately excluded from this PR:

1. **Temporary Batch Files**:
   - `run-ideate.bat`, `run-roundtable.bat`, `run-refine-concept.bat`, etc.
   - These files were used to work around PowerShell command length limitations
   - The README contains examples for users to create their own batch files if needed

2. **Test Scripts**:
   - `test-concept.js`, `test-prd.js`, `scripts/test-round-table.js`
   - These were used for isolated testing of individual workflow components
   - Unit and integration tests included in the standard test suite cover this functionality

3. **Temporary Documentation**:
   - Development planning files like `time-line.txt`
   - Draft PR notes that have been consolidated into this PR description

4. **Example Output Files**:
   - Example PRD outputs generated during testing
   - These are not included as they would add unnecessary files to the repo

The `.gitignore` file has been updated to exclude these temporary development files.
