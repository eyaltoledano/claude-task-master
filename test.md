cool, based on this PR description, can you get it and try testing it works well with a new PRD and a new tag and parsing the PRD and running analyze-complexity and expanding all, then we can try the new mcp tool commands 


Important:
I see - the WorkflowOrchestrator uses an event-driven architecture with transition() method. I need to revise the WorkflowService significantly. Given the complexity and time, let me create a simpler version that works with the actual WorkflowOrchestrator API and
  focuses on getting autopilot-start working first.

  Let me create a summary of what we've accomplished and what still needs to be done:

  Summary

  We've made excellent progress on the refactoring! Here's what's been accomplished:

  âœ… Completed

  1. Domain Layer Architecture - Proper separation of concerns established
  2. WorkflowStateManager - Owns all JSON file access with backup support
  3. apps/mcp TypeScript package - Full setup with proper structure
  4. Shared MCP utilities - ContentResult responses, path normalization with proper precedence
  5. autopilot-start tool - Migrated to TypeScript in apps/mcp
  6. mcp-server integration - Updated to import from apps/mcp

  ðŸ”„ Issues Found

  The WorkflowService needs to be revised to work with the WorkflowOrchestrator's actual event-driven API. The orchestrator uses:
  - transition(event) - not direct phase manipulation methods
  - Event-based state machine - RED/GREEN/COMMIT transitions via events
  - No fromState() static method - uses restoreState() instance method

  ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

  1. Simplify WorkflowService to work with the actual Workflow Orchestrator API
  2. Test autopilot-start to ensure basic workflow creation works
  3. Migrate remaining 6 tools once the pattern is validated

  Would you like me to:
  A) Fix the WorkflowService to work with the actual WorkflowOrchestrator API?
  B) Create a simpler interim version that just handles state persistence and let the MCP tools work more directly with WorkflowOrchestrator?
  C) Something else?

  The core architecture is solid - we just need to align the service layer with how WorkflowOrchestrator actually works.
