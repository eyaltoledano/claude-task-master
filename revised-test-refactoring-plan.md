# Revised Test Refactoring Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation (Essential First Steps)

### 1.1 Setup and Documentation
- Create the `TESTING.md` document with testing standards
- Reorganize the test directory structure
- Add core test utility functions
- Set up separate npm scripts for different test types

### 1.2 Reference Implementations
- Implement 1-2 exemplary tests for each test type
- Document patterns used in these tests
- Update project CI configuration to run the test suite

**Relative Effort**: Small to Medium (5-10% of total refactoring effort)  
**Dependencies**: None - this phase must be completed first  
**Success Criteria**: New test structure in place, documentation available, example tests passing

## Phase 2: Critical Path Coverage

### 2.1 High-Value Testing
- Identify most critical functionality (likely the `.taskmaster/` structure features)
- Implement proper tests for these components first:
  - Core CLI commands (init, parse-prd)
  - File system operations
  - Directory structure management

### 2.2 New Feature Tests
- Focus on the feature/tm-dir branch functionality
- Replace problematic test implementations with properly structured tests
- Ensure all new functionality has test coverage

**Relative Effort**: Medium (15-25% of total effort)  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1  
**Success Criteria**: All new features have properly structured tests, critical path functionality covered

## Phase 3: Test Migration (Largest Phase)

### 3.1 Triage Existing Tests
- Categorize all existing tests by complexity:
  - Simple: Implementation is OK but needs minor fixes
  - Medium: Needs restructuring but core logic is salvageable
  - Complex: Needs complete rewrite
- Document reason for each skipped test

### 3.2 Progressive Refactoring
- Start with simple tests, then medium, then complex
- For each test:
  - Move to appropriate directory (/unit, /integration, /e2e)
  - Refactor using the new patterns
  - Unskip if possible
  - Document if still needs skipping

**Relative Effort**: Large (40-60% of total effort)  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-2  
**Success Criteria**: All salvageable tests refactored, remainder clearly documented for future work

## Phase 4: Coverage Completion

### 4.1 Gap Analysis
- Run coverage analysis to identify untested code
- Prioritize coverage gaps:
  - High: Core functionality with no tests
  - Medium: Supporting functionality with no tests
  - Low: Edge cases and error handling

### 4.2 Integration and E2E Focus
- Ensure full CLI command coverage with E2E tests
- Add comprehensive integration tests for module interactions
- Test typical user workflows end-to-end

**Relative Effort**: Medium to Large (20-30% of total effort)  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-3  
**Success Criteria**: Coverage metrics meet targets, all key workflows tested

## Phase 5: Maintenance Infrastructure

### 5.1 CI Pipeline Integration
- Update CI pipeline with proper test stages
- Add test reports and coverage to CI dashboard
- Set up test quality metrics

### 5.2 Long-term Governance
- Create documentation for maintaining tests going forward
- Establish review standards for new tests
- Set up automated test quality checks

**Relative Effort**: Small (5-10% of total effort)  
**Dependencies**: Phases 1-4  
**Success Criteria**: Automated test suite running in CI, quality checks in place

## Prioritization Recommendations

When allocating resources to this refactoring, consider this prioritization:

1. **Must Have**: Phases 1 and 2.1 (Foundation and Critical Path)
2. **Should Have**: Phases 2.2 and 3.1 (New Features and Triage)
3. **High Value**: Phase 3.2 (Progressive Refactoring)
4. **Important**: Phase 4 (Coverage Completion)
5. **Long-term Value**: Phase 5 (Maintenance Infrastructure)

This phase-based approach allows you to:
- Start with the highest value work
- Make incremental improvements
- Adapt the plan based on discoveries during the refactoring
- Pause between phases if other priorities arise
