# CLI Product Requirements Generator Concept

## Executive Summary
The CLI Product Requirements Generator is a command-line interface tool that transforms raw product ideas into structured, comprehensive product requirement documents (PRDs) through an interactive, AI-assisted workflow. It bridges the gap between initial concepts and formal documentation, enabling product managers, developers, and stakeholders to efficiently create professional PRDs without leaving the terminal environment.

## Problem Statement
Creating well-structured PRDs is time-consuming and often challenging, especially for those with limited product management experience. Current solutions are either:
- Too complex (enterprise PM tools)
- Too simplistic (templates)
- Not integrated into developer workflows
- Lacking intelligent assistance to improve document quality

Developers and technical product managers need a tool that fits naturally into their CLI-based workflow while providing intelligent guidance to transform ideas into actionable requirements.

## Target Users
### Primary: Technical Product Managers
- Work closely with engineering teams
- Comfortable with command-line interfaces
- Need to quickly document product requirements
- Value efficiency and integration with technical workflows

### Secondary: Developers in Product-Focused Roles
- Engineers responsible for feature specifications
- Technical leads defining project requirements
- Open-source maintainers documenting feature plans
- Startup founders wearing multiple hats

### Tertiary: Product Management Students/Newcomers
- Learning product management practices
- Need guidance on PRD structure and content
- Want to build portfolio materials

## Proposed Solution
A command-line interface application that guides users through an interactive, AI-assisted process to develop comprehensive PRDs from initial ideas. The tool will combine structured templates, intelligent prompting, and contextual suggestions to help users articulate requirements effectively while maintaining the speed and efficiency of CLI workflows.

## Key Features
- **Interactive PRD Creation Workflow**: Step-by-step guided process with intelligent prompts for each PRD section
- **AI-Powered Content Suggestions**: Contextual recommendations for improving clarity, completeness, and quality
- **Template Library**: Multiple PRD templates for different project types (feature, product, technical, etc.)
- **Version Control Integration**: Native support for Git to track document changes over time
- **Export Options**: Generate documents in multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML, etc.)
- **Collaboration Features**: Comment/feedback functionality and multi-user editing capabilities
- **Requirements Validation**: Automated checks for completeness, clarity, and consistency
- **Custom Fields & Extensions**: Ability to define organization-specific sections and requirements
- **Command Completion**: Tab completion for commands and intelligent content suggestions

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: Number of active users and frequency of use
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of started PRDs that reach completion
- **Time Savings**: Average time to create a complete PRD compared to traditional methods
- **Quality Improvement**: Reduction in PRD revisions required before approval
- **User Satisfaction**: NPS score and qualitative feedback from users
- **Community Engagement**: Contributions to templates and extensions

## Constraints & Requirements
- **Technical**:
  - Must work across major operating systems (macOS, Linux, Windows)
  - Minimal external dependencies to ensure reliability
  - Support for offline operation with reduced AI capabilities
  - Responsive performance even with large documents

- **Business**:
  - Initial MVP should focus on core PRD creation workflow
  - AI features may require subscription model for sustainability
  - Open-source core with potential premium features

- **User Experience**:
  - Learning curve must be minimal for CLI-familiar users
  - Commands should follow established CLI conventions
  - Must provide clear help documentation and examples

## Open Questions
- What is the right balance between structured templates and flexibility?
- How can we ensure the AI suggestions remain relevant across different industries and product types?
- Should the tool integrate with existing PM tools (Jira, Asana, etc.) or remain standalone?
- What level of customization should be available without compromising usability?
- How can we build a community around template sharing and best practices?
- What privacy considerations need to be addressed when using AI to process potentially sensitive product information?
