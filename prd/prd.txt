# PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT: TASK MASTER
===============================================

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------------------------------------
Task Master is a developer-centric task management system designed to eliminate context switching for software development teams. It features a primary CLI interface with a complementary web dashboard, deep Git integration, sophisticated dependency tracking, and seamless connections with existing project management tools. The system enables developers to manage tasks without leaving their workflow, improving productivity and reducing time spent on status updates.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------------------------------------
Software developers face significant productivity loss due to context switching between development environments and task management tools. Current solutions:
- Are not integrated with Git workflows
- Require frequent context switching
- Lack developer-friendly interfaces
- Don't effectively track task dependencies
- Create overhead for status reporting

Task Master addresses these issues by bringing task management directly into the developer's workflow with Git-native integration and a CLI-first approach.

## PRODUCT GOALS
-----------------------------------------------
1. Reduce context switching time by 50% for developers
2. Provide seamless Git workflow integration
3. Enable effective dependency tracking and visualization
4. Offer both CLI and web interfaces with consistent experience
5. Support integration with existing project management tools
6. Improve estimation accuracy through historical data analysis
7. Reduce time spent in status update meetings by 30%
