# Product Requirements Document: Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform

## Executive Summary

The Decentralized Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform (DCEP) is a next-generation trading solution that addresses the fundamental limitations of centralized exchanges by empowering users with complete control over their digital assets while providing a seamless trading experience. DCEP leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless environment where users can trade directly from their wallets, eliminating intermediaries and their associated risks.
