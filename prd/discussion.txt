# Product Round-Table Discussion: CLI Product Requirements Generator

## Initial Discussion

**product_manager**: Welcome everyone. Today we're discussing the CLI Product Requirements Generator concept. I'm excited about this tool because it addresses a real gap in the market - the lack of efficient PRD creation tools for technical PMs and developers. My initial thoughts are that the CLI approach gives us a unique angle compared to GUI-based competitors. What are your first impressions?

**developer**: From a technical perspective, I like the CLI focus - it's where many of us spend our day anyway. However, I immediately see some implementation challenges. Building a truly responsive CLI with AI capabilities will require careful architecture decisions. We'd need to consider how much processing happens locally versus in the cloud, especially for the AI suggestions feature. Also, the Git integration sounds promising but could get complex quickly.

**designer**: While I appreciate the focus on CLI for the target audience, I'm concerned about the user experience. CLI tools traditionally sacrifice discoverability and visual hierarchy for efficiency. Even technical users benefit from thoughtful UX. We'll need to ensure the interactive workflow is intuitive and that the output documents are well-formatted and professional. Just because it's in the terminal doesn't mean it can't have a strong, guided experience.

**product_manager**: Those are valid points. The target users are technically sophisticated, but we shouldn't use that as an excuse for a poor experience. Let's dig deeper into the strengths and weaknesses. I see the main strengths as workflow integration for developers, the AI assistance for improving document quality, and the efficiency of creating PRDs without context switching. What do you both see as the primary weaknesses?

**developer**: My biggest concern is the technical complexity of delivering all these features in a CLI environment. Features like "AI-Powered Content Suggestions" and "Requirements Validation" will require sophisticated NLP capabilities. Then there's the multi-format export, which means we need reliable rendering engines. And the "minimal external dependencies" constraint conflicts with these advanced features. We might need to prioritize which features make it into the MVP.

**designer**: I'm worried about the collaboration aspects. The concept mentions "multi-user editing capabilities," but real-time collaboration in a CLI tool is extremely challenging. Even asynchronous collaboration would require careful design. How will users know what changed and who changed it? How will they resolve conflicts? The comment functionality also needs thoughtful implementation - comments in a terminal interface aren't exactly standard.

## Challenges and Risks

**product_manager**: You've both highlighted important challenges. Let me add a business risk: we're targeting a relatively niche audience - technical PMs and developers who write PRDs and prefer CLI. While growing, this might be too narrow for sustainable growth. We should consider how to expand the addressable market over time, perhaps through companion tools or broader use cases. What other risks do you see?

**developer**: There's a significant technical risk around AI integration. The concept states it should work offline with "reduced AI capabilities," but that's tricky. Either we need to package a lightweight ML model with the tool (increasing its size dramatically) or we're always dependent on an internet connection for core functionality. Also, version control integration sounds simple but can be a rabbit hole - especially handling merge conflicts in structured documents.

**designer**: User adoption is a major risk. CLI tools have higher learning curves by nature, and we're adding complex functionality on top. If users can't quickly understand how to use it effectively, they'll abandon it. Also, there's the output quality risk - if the generated PRDs don't look professional or contain useful content, it reflects poorly on the users when they share these documents with stakeholders.

**product_manager**: Great points. There's also the competitive risk. While there aren't many CLI-based PRD tools, there are plenty of AI writing assistants emerging that could target this space. We need to ensure our specialized focus on PRDs provides enough value to compete with general-purpose tools. Let's shift to potential improvements and alternatives - how could we strengthen this concept?

## Improvements and Alternatives

**developer**: I think we should consider a hybrid approach. Keep the core CLI for efficiency, but offer a web-based viewer for collaboration and reviewing the formatted output. This addresses the collaboration challenges while maintaining the CLI workflow. For the MVP, we could focus on local-first operation with Git for version control, then add the more complex multi-user features later. We should also consider using existing libraries for document generation rather than building everything from scratch.

**designer**: I like the hybrid approach. Another improvement would be to focus heavily on the guided experience - making the CLI tool conversational and helpful. We could implement a TUI (Text-based User Interface) for certain complex interactions rather than pure command-line, giving some visual structure while staying in the terminal. For templates, we should provide fewer but higher-quality options initially, with clear documentation on how to customize them.

**product_manager**: Those are excellent suggestions. I'd add that we should consider a tiered approach to features. The free tier could include basic PRD creation with templates, while premium features might include the AI assistance and advanced collaboration. This would allow us to monetize while building the user base. We should also emphasize integration with existing tools through exports or APIs - perhaps allowing export directly to Confluence, Notion, or other documentation systems.

**developer**: Speaking of integration, we should prioritize hooks or plugins that let users extend the tool. This could create a community around the product and allow for specialized templates and workflows. For example, a team could create custom validation rules specific to their organization's requirements. On the technical side, we might want to implement this in a language with strong cross-platform support like Rust or Go, rather than Python or Node which have more dependency challenges.

**designer**: For the experience, I'd recommend starting with a small set of well-defined commands that follow existing CLI conventions. We could take inspiration from tools like Git that use subcommands for different functionality. Clear help text and examples are critical. We should also consider implementing an interactive "wizard" mode for new users that guides them through the process step by step, while allowing power users to use direct commands for efficiency.

## Technical Feasibility and Implementation

**product_manager**: Let's discuss implementation more specifically. What's realistic for an MVP, and what would be the technical approach you'd recommend?

**developer**: For an MVP, I'd focus on core functionality: template selection, guided PRD creation, local saving, and basic exports to Markdown and HTML. I'd implement this as a stateful CLI application using a language like Rust for performance and cross-platform compatibility. The AI features would require an API connection to a service like OpenAI, with graceful degradation when offline. For version control, I'd simply make the tool generate files in a format that works well with Git, rather than trying to implement Git features directly.

**designer**: From a UX perspective, the MVP should focus on making the guided creation process extremely smooth. I envision a step-by-step workflow where each section of the PRD is handled separately, with clear prompts and examples. For the TUI elements, libraries like Charm's Bubble Tea or similar frameworks could provide interactive components while maintaining the terminal aesthetic. The export formats should be limited but highly polished - better to have two excellent output formats than five mediocre ones.

**product_manager**: I agree with focusing the MVP. For content, we should start with 3-4 high-quality templates that cover common use cases: a standard PRD, a technical specification, a feature brief, and perhaps an MRD (Market Requirements Document). The AI assistance in the MVP could be focused on specific high-value areas: improving requirement clarity, suggesting missing sections, and helping with user story formation. This would demonstrate value while keeping scope manageable.

**developer**: For the architecture, I'd suggest a local-first approach where the core application runs entirely on the user's machine, with optional cloud services for the AI components and potential future collaboration features. This addresses privacy concerns with sensitive product information. We should use a structured document format internally (perhaps YAML or JSON) that can be easily transformed into different output formats and is also Git-friendly for diffing and merging.

**designer**: We should also consider accessibility in the terminal. Many developers use screen readers or have specific color scheme requirements. Making sure our TUI components work well with various terminal configurations and assistive technologies would set us apart. For the output documents, we should ensure they're not just visually appealing but also structurally sound - with proper headings, lists, and other semantic elements that make them accessible and professional.

## Business Viability and Market Potential

**product_manager**: Let's talk about market potential. While our primary audience is technical PMs and developers, I see potential expansion paths. As teams adopt this tool, non-technical PMs might become interested in the output quality, leading to demand for companion tools or interfaces. What are your thoughts on market size and monetization?

**developer**: The developer tools market is substantial, but monetization can be challenging. Developers expect high-quality free tools and only pay for significant value-adds. A freemium model makes sense - free core functionality with paid advanced features. The AI capabilities provide a natural monetization point since they have associated costs. For market size, there are millions of developers globally, but we'd be targeting the subset involved in product definition - perhaps 10-20% of that market.

**designer**: I see potential in the education market as well. The guided nature of this tool makes it valuable for teaching product management concepts. Universities and bootcamps teaching product management could adopt this to help students learn structured PRD creation. This could be a separate pricing tier with specific templates and more extensive guidance features.

**product_manager**: Good insights. I also see potential for team and enterprise tiers that offer advanced collaboration, custom templates, and integration with enterprise systems. The initial focus on individual technical users gives us a wedge into organizations, but the long-term growth would come from team adoption. We should design the architecture with this expansion in mind, even if the MVP focuses on individual use.

**developer**: For sustainable growth, we should consider an open-core model. The basic CLI tool could be open source, building community and adoption, while we offer premium features and hosted services for teams and enterprises. This approach has worked well for developer tools like GitLab and Hashicorp products. It also addresses the "build vs. buy" decision that many technical teams face - they can start with the free version and upgrade as needed.

**designer**: From a market differentiation perspective, I think leaning into the quality of the output documents and the efficiency of the process would be key. Many tools can help create documents, but if ours genuinely saves time while producing better results, that's compelling. User testimonials and case studies showing the time saved and improvement in PRD quality would be powerful marketing tools.

## User Experience and Adoption

**product_manager**: Adoption will be critical to our success. How do we ensure users not only try the tool but continue using it? What's the ideal onboarding experience?

**designer**: For onboarding, I'd recommend a "quick win" approach. The first-run experience should guide users to create a simple but complete PRD within 10-15 minutes. This builds confidence and demonstrates value immediately. We should include examples and shortcuts to help users understand what good looks like. The CLI should provide progressive disclosure - basic commands are simple, with advanced features discoverable as users become more experienced.

**developer**: From a technical perspective, installation needs to be frictionless. We should support package managers like Homebrew, apt, and Chocolatey, plus offer direct downloads. The tool should detect the user's environment and adapt automatically - for example, identifying their preferred editor for opening generated files. Performance is also critical for adoption - the tool must start quickly and respond immediately, even if some AI features require a moment to process.

**product_manager**: I agree with both points. We should also consider the lifecycle of PRD creation. Users may start a document, share it for feedback, revise it, and finalize it. The tool should support this workflow naturally, perhaps with commands like `prd draft`, `prd share`, `prd revise`, and `prd finalize`. Each command would guide the user through appropriate steps for that stage of the process.

**designer**: For sustained adoption, the tool should grow with the user. As they become more experienced, they'll want more control and customization. We should provide a clear path from guided wizards to power-user commands and custom templates. The documentation should include both beginner tutorials and advanced usage examples. I'd also recommend including subtle tips within the tool itself to help users discover more efficient workflows.

**developer**: To encourage adoption within teams, we should make sharing and collaboration as seamless as possible, even in the MVP. This could be as simple as standardized output formats and Git-friendly file structures, with more sophisticated collaboration features coming later. We might also consider a plugin for code editors like VS Code, allowing users to work with PRDs in their preferred environment while still leveraging our tool's capabilities.

**product_manager**: Those are excellent suggestions. To measure adoption success, we should implement lightweight analytics (with user consent) to understand which features are most used and where users might be struggling. This data would guide our roadmap and help us improve the user experience over time.

## Summary and Key Recommendations

**product_manager**: Let's summarize our key recommendations for improving this concept:

1. **Adopt a hybrid approach**: CLI core for efficiency with potential web-based components for collaboration and document review.

2. **Focus the MVP** on core functionality: template selection, guided PRD creation, local saving, and polished exports to a limited number of formats.

3. **Implement a tiered business model**: Free core functionality with premium features for AI assistance and team collaboration.

4. **Prioritize UX despite the CLI paradigm**: Use TUI elements where appropriate, ensure clear guidance, and make the tool accessible.

5. **Build with extensibility in mind**: Create hooks for plugins and custom templates to foster community and address diverse needs.

6. **Design for quality output**: Ensure generated PRDs are professional, well-structured, and reflect well on the users.

7. **Consider a local-first architecture** with optional cloud services for AI and collaboration to address privacy concerns.

8. **Create a seamless onboarding experience** that delivers value within minutes and grows with user expertise.

9. **Plan for expansion beyond the initial target market** with potential paths into team usage, enterprise adoption, and educational settings.

10. **Support the entire PRD lifecycle** from initial drafting through collaboration, revision, and finalization.

These recommendations maintain the core concept while addressing the challenges and risks we've identified. The result should be a more viable product with stronger market potential and user adoption prospects.

**developer**: I agree with this summary and would emphasize the importance of technical excellence in implementation. The tool should feel responsive, reliable, and professional, even in its command-line format.

**designer**: And I'd add that despite being CLI-based, the user experience should remain a top priority. If we execute this well, we could create a tool that's not just accepted by technical users but genuinely loved for its efficiency and thoughtfulness.
