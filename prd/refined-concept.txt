# Task Management System for Software Development Teams

## Overview
A developer-centric task management system designed to eliminate context switching for software development teams. The system features a primary CLI interface with an accompanying web dashboard, deeply integrates with Git workflows, provides sophisticated dependency tracking between tasks, and offers clear visibility into project progress while seamlessly connecting with existing project management tools.

## Core Features

### Git Integration
- Automatic task status updates based on commit messages and branch activities using libgit2
- Branch naming conventions that link directly to tasks with configurable patterns
- Git-hook based workflow automation with pre-commit, post-commit, and pre-push hooks
- Multi-repository support via workspace concept for microservice architectures
- Lightweight metadata storage in Git-ignored directories to maintain repository integrity
- Support for distributed teams with conflict resolution mechanisms similar to Git itself

### Task Management
- Dependency tracking with circular dependency detection using directed acyclic graph models
- Visualization of dependency graphs (ASCII art in CLI, interactive diagrams in web)
- Custom workflow states and transitions to support Kanban, Scrum, and other methodologies
- Tagging and categorization system for flexible organization
- Full-text search capabilities across tasks with relevance ranking
- Batch operations for efficient task manipulation

### Interface Options
- Primary CLI interface optimized for developer workflows using clap/cobra for command parsing
- Text-based UI using ncurses for in-terminal dashboard with ANSI terminal standards
- Complementary web dashboard built with Svelte/Vue for broader team visibility
- Consistent design language and terminology across interfaces
- Progressive disclosure of advanced features through intelligent command suggestions
- Keyboard shortcuts and command aliases for power users

### Time & Progress Tracking
- Optional time tracking with focus on estimation vs. actual as learning tool
- Burndown charts and velocity metrics with statistical analysis
- Customizable reporting for sprint reviews and retrospectives
- Historical data analysis for improving future estimates
- Anomaly detection to identify tasks that deviate significantly from estimates
- Export capabilities for executive reporting and team retrospectives

### Integration Capabilities
- Bidirectional synchronization with existing tools (Jira, GitHub Issues, GitLab, etc.)
- CI/CD pipeline integration (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) with event triggers
- Extensible plugin architecture with versioned API and documentation
- Webhook support for event-driven automation
- GraphQL API for custom integrations and data access
- Rate limiting and caching mechanisms to prevent API abuse

### Team Collaboration
- Notification system for blocked tasks and dependency changes (configurable)
- Comment threads linked to specific tasks with markdown support
- @mentions and assignment tracking with smart suggestions
- Activity feeds showing recent project changes
- Configurable alerts for stalled tasks or approaching deadlines
- Team workload visualization to prevent overallocation

## Target Users
- Software developers (primary)
- Technical project managers
- QA engineers
- DevOps teams
- Product managers
- Non-technical stakeholders (via web dashboard)
- Open source project maintainers
- Technical documentation writers

## Success Metrics
- Reduced context switching time for developers (measurable in minutes saved per day)
- Improved accuracy of dependency tracking and reduced blocked time
- Better cross-team visibility into project status
- Seamless integration with existing Git workflows
- Faster onboarding for new team members
- More accurate time estimation over time
- Reduction in status update meetings
- Increased developer satisfaction measured through surveys

## Technical Architecture
- Core library written in Rust for performance, safety, and cross-platform compatibility
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns following hexagonal architecture
- Local data storage in Git-ignored directories using SQLite with JSON export capability
- Optional remote synchronization via self-hosted or cloud service
- Event-sourced data model for robust history and audit capabilities
- Composable, modular design following Unix philosophy
- Comprehensive plugin API with capability-based security model
- Efficient data synchronization with conflict resolution strategies
- Memory-efficient operation even with large task sets
- Horizontal scaling support for enterprise deployments

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Git integration and basic task management with CLI interface
2. **Phase 2**: Dependency tracking and advanced task relationships
3. **Phase 3**: Team dashboard, web interface, and reporting capabilities
4. **Phase 4**: CI/CD integration and advanced workflow automation
5. **Phase 5**: Extended integrations and enterprise features
6. **Phase 6**: Advanced analytics, machine learning for estimation improvement
7. **Phase 7**: Mobile companion app and expanded platform support

## Constraints & Requirements
- Must work across major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Should be extensible via well-documented plugin API with versioning
- Must not interfere with existing Git functionality
- Should support offline operation with synchronization when online
- Installation process should require minimal steps (single command install)
- Must provide clear migration paths from popular existing tools
- Data export/import capabilities for portability
- Should operate efficiently on limited hardware resources
- Must scale to support repositories with 10,000+ tasks
- Response time for common operations under 100ms
