# Claude Task Master Integration for Roo Code

## Implementation Overview

This integration brings Claude Task Master functionality to Roo Code (a fork of Cline), enabling task management capabilities with any model via OpenRouter API. The implementation includes:

1. **Core Task Management Functions**:
   - Task creation, reading, updating and deletion
   - Status management (pending, in-progress, done, deferred)
   - Task expansion and subtask generation
   - Complexity analysis using AI
   - File generation and JSON operations

2. **Key Technical Decisions**:
   - Maintained original task manager logic while adapting for TypeScript
   - Preserved all core functionality from original implementation
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling

3. **Integration Points**:
   - Uses OpenRouter API for AI interactions
   - Works with any supported model
   - Maintains compatibility with existing task JSON structure

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Operations

1. **Create a new task**:
```typescript
import { addTask } from './integrations/taskmaster';
await addTask('Implement user authentication', [1, 2], 'high');
```

2. **List all tasks**:
```typescript
import { listTasks } from './integrations/taskmaster';
await listTasks();
```

3. **Update task status**:
```typescript
import { setTaskStatus } from './integrations/taskmaster';
await setTaskStatus(1, 'in-progress');
```

### Advanced Features

1. **Task Expansion**:
```typescript
import { expandTask } from './integrations/taskmaster';
await expandTask(1, 3); // Expands task with ID 1 into 3 subtasks
```

2. **Complexity Analysis**:
```typescript
import { analyzeTaskComplexity } from './integrations/taskmaster';
await analyzeTaskComplexity(); // Generates complexity-report.json
```

3. **Batch Operations**:
```typescript
import { expandAllTasks } from './integrations/taskmaster';
await expandAllTasks(); // Expands all eligible tasks
```

## Implementation Notes

1. **File Structure**:
   - Tasks are stored in `tasks/tasks.json`
   - Complexity reports in `tasks/complexity-report.json`
   - Generated task files in specified output directory

2. **Dependencies**:
   - Requires OpenRouter API key in environment variables
   - Uses original task-manager.js logic for core operations

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Comprehensive error handling for all operations
   - Graceful fallbacks for missing files
   - Clear console feedback for all operations

## Future Improvements

1. Add support for task prioritization algorithms
2. Implement task dependency visualization
3. Add more detailed progress tracking
4. Enhance complexity analysis with historical data

## 25/03/2025, 4:50:24 am
