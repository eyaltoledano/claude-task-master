# NAACL 2025 Complexity Analysis Enhancement

Task Master's complexity analysis system enhanced with NAACL 2025-inspired prompt compression techniques.

## ðŸš€ New Feature: User-Selectable Complexity Modes

Task Master now supports three complexity analysis modes, allowing users to balance accuracy and cost:

- **Standard Mode**: Ultra-compressed (783 chars) for quick, cost-effective analysis
- **Balanced Mode**: Middle-ground (2,100 chars) for optimal quality/cost ratio (DEFAULT)
- **Advanced Mode**: Full enhanced (5,711 chars) for detailed, comprehensive analysis

## Usage

Configure via CLI:

```bash
task-master analyze-complexity --complexity-mode=standard
task-master analyze-complexity --complexity-mode=balanced  # default
task-master analyze-complexity --complexity-mode=advanced
```

Or via configuration file:

```json
{
	"global": {
		"complexityMode": "balanced"
	}
}
```

## Documentation

- **[`METHODOLOGY.md`](./METHODOLOGY.md)** - Technical implementation details and compression techniques
- **[`complexity-modes-impact-analysis.md`](./complexity-modes-impact-analysis.md)** - Real test results showing performance of each mode

## Key Results

### Compression Achievements

- **7.3x compression ratio** (standard mode vs advanced mode)
- **64% cost reduction** while maintaining analysis quality
- **Configurable trade-offs** between speed/cost and detail

### Quality Validation

- âœ… Structured 5-dimensional analysis framework preserved
- âœ… Mathematical precision maintained in compressed formats
- âœ… Actionable expansion prompts generated consistently
- âœ… Real-world testing validates effectiveness across all modes

## Implementation

The complexity modes are implemented in:

- `scripts/modules/task-manager/analyze-task-complexity.js` - Core analysis logic
- `scripts/modules/config-manager.js` - Configuration management
- `scripts/modules/commands.js` - CLI interface

This feature demonstrates successful application of academic prompt compression research to production systems, achieving enhanced capability with improved efficiency.
