# Product Requirements Document: Claude Task Master

## 1. Executive Summary

Claude Task Master is a Node.js application designed to manage and execute tasks with Claude AI models. The system consists of a core task management engine, a REST API server, and a command-line interface. It provides functionality for task creation, execution, monitoring, and result handling. The application uses a context management system to maintain state across interactions with Claude AI models and implements various strategies for task execution and error handling.

This PRD outlines requirements for improving the existing codebase, enhancing features, and addressing technical debt to create a more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly task management system for Claude AI interactions.

## 2. Current State Assessment

The codebase currently implements:
- A core task management system
- Context management for maintaining state
- REST API endpoints for task operations
- CLI interface for command-line interactions
- Basic error handling and logging
- Task execution strategies
- Integration with Claude AI models

Key challenges identified:
- Inconsistent error handling
- Limited test coverage
- Lack of comprehensive documentation
- Performance bottlenecks in task execution
- Security vulnerabilities in API endpoints
- Dependency management issues
- Inconsistent code style and patterns
