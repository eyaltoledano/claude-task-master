# Product Requirements Document: Claude Task Master

## 1. Executive Summary

Claude Task Master is a Node.js application designed to manage and execute tasks using the Claude AI model. The system consists of a task master core, context manager, and various utilities for handling Claude API interactions, task execution, and result processing. The application appears to be designed for asynchronous task processing with Claude AI, featuring capabilities for context management, task prioritization, and execution tracking.

The codebase requires significant improvements in error handling, testing coverage, documentation, and architecture to enhance reliability, maintainability, and scalability. This PRD outlines comprehensive requirements to address these issues and improve the overall quality and functionality of the application.
