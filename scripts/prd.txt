# Product Requirements Document: Claude Task Master

## 1. Executive Summary

Claude Task Master is a Node.js application designed to manage and execute tasks using the Claude AI model. The system consists of a task master core, context manager, and various utilities for handling task execution, retry logic, and API interactions. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between task management, context handling, and API communication.

The codebase needs significant improvements in error handling, testing coverage, documentation, and overall architecture to enhance reliability, maintainability, and scalability. This PRD outlines comprehensive requirements to address these issues and improve the product's quality and functionality.
