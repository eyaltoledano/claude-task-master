## 🔄 **How AST Enhances Existing Workflow**

### **Current Subtask Flow**:
```
User starts subtask → Generate CLAUDE.md → Claude works with basic context
```

### **AST-Enhanced Flow**:
```
User starts subtask → AST analyzes code → Enhanced CLAUDE.md → Claude works with rich code context
```

## 🌍 **Multi-Language Support Strategy**

### **Phase 1 Languages** (High Priority):
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Using TypeScript Compiler API
