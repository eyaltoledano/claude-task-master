## 🛠️ Developer Guide

### Adding New Tests

1. **Identify the appropriate phase** based on test scope:
   - **Unit**: Single component functionality
   - **Integration**: Component interaction
   - **E2E**: Complete user workflows
   - **Visual**: UI component behavior

2. **Follow established patterns**:
   ```bash
   # Review existing tests in the same category
   ls unit/ast/                 # For AST unit tests
   ls integration/              # For integration tests
   ls visual/                   # For UI tests
   ```

3. **Use consistent naming**:
   - `component-name.test.js` for unit tests
   - `feature-integration.test.js` for integration tests
   - `workflow-name.js` for e2e tests

4. **Update phase runners** when adding new test files

### Testing Patterns

#### Mock Strategy
```javascript
// Comprehensive mocking for unit tests
jest.mock('../actual-module', () => ({
  actualFunction: jest.fn(),
  actualClass: jest.fn()
}));

// Selective mocking for integration tests  
jest.mock('../external-dependency', () => ({
  ...jest.requireActual('../external-dependency'),
  externalCall: jest.fn()
}));

// Minimal mocking for e2e tests
// Use real implementations when possible
```

#### Performance Testing
```javascript
// Performance benchmarks
const startTime = performance.now();
await operationUnderTest();
const duration = performance.now() - startTime;
expect(duration).toBeLessThan(100); // 100ms target
```

#### Error Handling
```javascript
// Comprehensive error testing
await expect(async () => {
  await operationThatShouldFail();
}).rejects.toThrow('Expected error message');
```

### Debugging Tests

#### Common Issues
1. **ES Module Import Errors**: Check `jest.config.js` configuration
2. **Mock Issues**: Verify mock placement and cleanup
3. **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout in test configuration
4. **Memory Issues**: Check for memory leaks in long-running tests

#### Debug Commands
```bash
# Run with detailed output
npx jest --verbose --no-cache unit/ast/language-detector.test.js

# Node.js debugging
node --inspect-brk node_modules/.bin/jest unit/ast/language-detector.test.js

# Memory profiling
node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/.bin/jest --logHeapUsage
```

### Contributing Guidelines

1. **Review the testing plan** in `../../../testing_plan.md`
2. **Follow established patterns** from existing phase implementations
3. **Update documentation** when adding new functionality
4. **Ensure all tests pass** before submitting changes
5. **Add appropriate phase runner updates** for new test files
