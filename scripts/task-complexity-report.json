      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Refactor codebase architecture",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the codebase refactoring task into specific implementation steps, focusing on module separation, interface standardization, and TypeScript conversion with clear acceptance criteria for each subtask.",
      "reasoning": "This is a high-complexity architectural task that touches the entire codebase. It involves multiple technical concepts (separation of concerns, TypeScript typing, module patterns) and requires deep understanding of the existing architecture. Breaking this into well-defined subtasks is critical to avoid scope creep."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Implement task prioritization and dependency system",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for implementing the task prioritization and dependency system, with each subtask focusing on a specific component like algorithm design, dependency tracking, cycle detection, visualization, and integration with the existing system.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex algorithmic work (prioritization algorithms, cycle detection) and requires careful design. It depends on the refactored architecture and will become a core system component. The visualization aspect adds UI complexity on top of the algorithmic challenges."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Enhance AI integration capabilities",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the AI integration enhancement task into subtasks covering multi-provider support, fallback mechanisms, caching implementation, context-aware prompting, and error handling, with clear interfaces between components.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integration with external AI services and implementing sophisticated features like fallbacks and context-awareness. The caching layer adds complexity, and proper error handling is critical. Multiple providers means dealing with different APIs and response formats."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement performance optimization and caching",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the performance optimization task into subtasks focusing on specific areas: database query optimization, caching layer implementation, connection pooling, memory usage patterns, request batching, and resource cleanup procedures.",
      "reasoning": "Performance optimization requires deep system knowledge and touches multiple components. Each optimization area (caching, queries, connection pooling) requires different expertise. Implementation requires careful measurement and validation to ensure improvements without regressions."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Create CLI user experience improvements",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for the CLI improvements focusing on interactive features, visual enhancements, help system implementation, and command history/shortcuts, with clear user experience goals for each component.",
      "reasoning": "This task is primarily focused on user experience rather than complex backend logic. While it requires good design and attention to detail, the technical complexity is moderate. The dependency on task #3 suggests integration with the prioritization system."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement collaboration features",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the collaboration features implementation into subtasks covering authentication system, access control, real-time collaboration mechanisms, notification system, commenting functionality, audit logging, and data consistency management.",
      "reasoning": "This is one of the most complex tasks as it transforms a single-user system into a multi-user platform. It involves authentication, authorization, real-time data synchronization, and notification systems. Each component has significant complexity and security implications."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Develop integration capabilities",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for the integration capabilities focusing on webhook system design, plugin architecture implementation, data import/export functionality, specific third-party integrations, and developer documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires designing extensible systems (webhooks, plugins) that will be used by external developers. It involves creating stable APIs, handling various data formats, and ensuring security for external connections. The documentation component is substantial."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement monitoring and observability",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the monitoring implementation into subtasks covering structured logging system, request tracing, metrics collection infrastructure, alerting system, and dashboard creation, with clear instrumentation standards for each component.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing instrumentation across the entire codebase and setting up infrastructure for metrics collection and alerting. While conceptually straightforward, it touches many components and requires careful design to avoid performance impacts."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Enhance test coverage and quality",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for enhancing test coverage focusing on unit testing framework improvements, integration test implementation, end-to-end test development, mocking strategy standardization, CI pipeline integration, and coverage reporting.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive testing requires significant effort across all system components. The high coverage target (85%) means substantial test writing. Creating proper integration and end-to-end tests requires sophisticated test infrastructure and deep system understanding."
