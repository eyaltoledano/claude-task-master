# Product Requirements Document: Claude Task Master

## 1. Executive Summary

Claude Task Master is a Node.js application designed to manage and execute tasks using the Claude AI model. The system consists of a task master core, a context manager, and various utilities for handling tasks, contexts, and API interactions. The application allows for the creation, management, and execution of tasks with Claude, supporting features like context management, task prioritization, and result handling.

Based on the codebase analysis, the application requires significant improvements in code quality, architecture, testing, documentation, and feature implementation to ensure reliability, maintainability, and scalability.

## 2. Current State Assessment

The codebase currently implements:
- A task master core for managing Claude tasks
- A context manager for handling task contexts
- Basic API interaction with Claude
- Task creation, execution, and result handling
- Simple logging and error handling

However, the codebase suffers from:
- Inconsistent error handling
- Limited test coverage
- Lack of comprehensive documentation
- Potential performance bottlenecks
- Architectural inconsistencies
- Dependency management issues
- Limited logging and monitoring
