# Product Requirements Document: Claude Task Master

## 1. Executive Summary

Based on the file structure analysis, Claude Task Master appears to be a task management system that likely integrates with AI services (specifically Claude) to help automate, organize, and execute tasks. The system consists of a server component (mcp-server), core functionality modules, and various utility scripts. The project has a testing framework in place with unit and integration tests, and appears to follow modern JavaScript development practices.

This PRD outlines improvements and feature implementations to enhance the Claude Task Master system's reliability, scalability, performance, and user experience.
