# Pull Request Notes: MCP Integration for PRD Workflow

## Feature Overview
This PR enhances the `generate-prd` command and related workflow to integrate with Cursor's Model Context Protocol (MCP). It automatically generates an `.cursor/mcp.json` configuration file when a PRD is created, allowing Cursor's AI assistant to directly access and work with Task Master's PRD and tasks. This enables a seamless AI-powered development experience from idea to implementation.

## Key Components
1. **New MCP Configuration Generator** in commands.js
2. **Enhanced PRD Generation Flow** to create MCP config files
3. **Cross-platform path normalization** for Windows compatibility
4. **Integration with existing workflow** (ideate → round-table → refine-concept → generate-prd)

## Implementation Details
- Added a `generateMcpConfigFile` function to create properly formatted MCP config files
- Enhanced `runGeneratePRDProcess` to automatically create MCP configuration on successful PRD generation
- Implemented path normalization to ensure cross-platform compatibility
- Graceful error handling to prevent MCP failures from interrupting the main workflow

## Usage Flow
Users can now:
1. Start with a raw idea using `ideate`
2. Simulate expert discussions with `round-table`
3. Refine their concept with `refine-concept`
4. Generate a complete PRD with `generate-prd`
5. **Automatically receive MCP configuration for Cursor integration**
6. Use Cursor's AI assistant to interact directly with the PRD and tasks

## MCP Configuration Details
The generated `.cursor/mcp.json` file:
- Configures a Node.js-based MCP server
- Provides the PRD file path as an environment variable
- Uses normalized paths for cross-platform compatibility
- Follows official MCP protocol specifications

## Testing Completed
- Tested MCP configuration generation on Windows and Unix platforms
- Verified path normalization for cross-platform compatibility
- Confirmed integration with existing command workflow
- Validated against current Cursor MCP requirements

## Documentation Added
- Code comments explaining MCP integration
- Log messages for monitoring MCP configuration process
- Error handling for graceful fallback

## Future Improvements
- Add more environment variables for enhanced MCP functionality
- Expose additional Task Master features through MCP
- Implement actual MCP server functionality
- Include tasks and discussions as MCP resources

## Reviewer Notes
- The MCP configuration generator only creates the necessary JSON structure
- The implementation of the actual MCP server functionality is left for future work
- This PR focuses specifically on enhancing the PRD workflow with MCP configuration
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
