# Pull Request Notes: Generate PRD Feature

## Feature Overview
This PR implements the `generate-prd` command and related sub-commands to facilitate PRD creation through a guided, interactive process. This addresses issue #37 by providing an intuitive way for users to create well-structured PRDs without having to bring their own PRD initially.

## Key Components
1. **New AI Service Functions** in ai-services.js
2. **Core Business Logic** in task-manager.js
3. **CLI Commands** in commands.js
4. **Documentation** in dev_workflow.mdc

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Improved package.json scripts for better cross-platform support
- Replaced Unix-specific `chmod` command with Node.js implementation that works on Windows and Unix systems
- Ensures seamless installation experience across different operating systems

## Usage Flow
Users can now:
1. Start with a raw idea
2. Convert it to a structured concept
3. Gather simulated expert feedback
4. Refine the concept
5. Generate a complete PRD
6. Use the PRD with existing Task Master functionality

## Testing Completed
- Individual command testing on all sub-commands
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Cross-platform compatibility verification

## Documentation Added
- Command references in dev_workflow.mdc
- Testing instructions in testing-instructions.md
- Implementation timeline in time-line.txt

## Future Improvements
- Enhanced template support
- Better validation for file inputs 
- More options for Perplexity research integration

## Reviewer Notes
- All code follows Task Master's "clear, simple, and concise" philosophy
- Maintains compatibility with existing commands and workflows
- Interactive prompts guide users through the PRD creation process
- Uses Claude API for AI-powered generation with streaming support
