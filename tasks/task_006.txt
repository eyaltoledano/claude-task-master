# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop PRD Parsing System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create functionality to parse PRDs and generate initial tasks
# Details:
Implement PRD file reading from specified file paths. Create prompt templates for PRD parsing following the specifications in the Appendix. Design the PRD to task conversion logic using Claude API. Add intelligent dependency inference to automatically determine task dependencies. Implement priority assignment logic based on the PRD content. Ensure generated tasks follow the Task model structure.

# Test Strategy:
Test with sample PRDs of varying complexity. Verify the generated tasks accurately reflect the PRD requirements. Check that dependencies are correctly inferred. Ensure priorities are appropriately assigned. Validate that the generated tasks can be saved to tasks.json.
