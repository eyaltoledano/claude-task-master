# Task ID: 6
# Title: Migrate Task Manager Core Modules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Convert core task management business logic to TypeScript with full type coverage
# Details:
Convert scripts/modules/task-manager and related core modules to TypeScript. Implement proper typing for task operations (create, update, delete, query). Add type-safe dependency resolution and validation. Implement typed event system for task state changes. Add proper error handling with custom typed exceptions. Ensure task serialization/deserialization maintains type safety.

# Test Strategy:
Run comprehensive task management tests to ensure functionality preservation. Test type safety in task operations and dependency resolution. Verify task state transitions are properly typed. Test serialization round-trip maintains type integrity.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Type task CRUD operations with proper return types and error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement strongly typed Create, Read, Update, Delete operations for tasks with comprehensive error handling and proper return types
### Details:
Define TypeScript interfaces for task operations, implement type-safe CRUD methods with Result<T, Error> pattern, add validation for input parameters, and ensure proper error propagation

## 2. Implement custom exception hierarchy for task operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create a comprehensive exception hierarchy specifically for task operations with typed error categories
### Details:
Design base TaskException class, implement specific exceptions like TaskNotFoundError, InvalidTaskStateError, DependencyViolationError, and ensure proper error typing throughout the system

## 3. Implement typed dependency graph resolution with cycle detection [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Build a type-safe dependency graph system that can resolve task dependencies and detect circular dependencies
### Details:
Create Graph<Task> data structure, implement topological sorting algorithm, add cycle detection using DFS, and provide typed interfaces for dependency resolution

## 4. Create typed event system for task state transitions and observers [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement a strongly typed event system to handle task state changes and notify observers
### Details:
Define TaskEvent types, implement EventEmitter<TaskEvent> pattern, create observer interfaces, and ensure type safety for event handlers and state transitions

## 5. Add type-safe task serialization/deserialization with schema validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement robust serialization system with schema validation for task persistence and data exchange
### Details:
Create JSON schema definitions, implement Serializer<Task> interface, add validation using libraries like Zod or Joi, and ensure type safety during data transformation

## 6. Type task query and filtering operations with builder pattern [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement a type-safe query builder system for filtering and searching tasks with fluent API
### Details:
Create TaskQueryBuilder class with fluent interface, implement type-safe filter methods, add support for complex queries, and ensure proper typing for query results

## 7. Add comprehensive business rule validation with typed constraints [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6
### Description: Implement a comprehensive validation system for business rules with strongly typed constraints
### Details:
Define ValidationRule<T> interfaces, implement constraint validators, create business rule engine, and integrate with all task operations to ensure data integrity and business logic compliance
