# Task ID: 9
# Title: Convert MCP Server Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate Model Context Protocol server implementation to TypeScript with protocol compliance
# Details:
Convert mcp-server/ modules to TypeScript with proper typing for MCP protocol messages and handlers. Implement type-safe message parsing and validation. Add proper typing for server lifecycle management and client connections. Implement typed error responses and protocol compliance validation. Add comprehensive logging with structured, typed log entries.

# Test Strategy:
Test MCP protocol compliance with various client scenarios. Verify message parsing and validation work correctly. Test server startup, shutdown, and error handling. Ensure protocol compatibility with existing MCP clients.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define MCP protocol message types following specification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create TypeScript type definitions for all MCP protocol message types including requests, responses, notifications, and error messages according to the official specification
### Details:
Define interfaces for protocol messages, method signatures, parameter types, and response schemas. Include proper typing for JSON-RPC 2.0 structure and MCP-specific extensions.

## 2. Implement typed request/response handlers with validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build request/response handler system with runtime validation using the defined message types from subtask 1
### Details:
Create handler registration system, implement request validation middleware, add response serialization, and ensure type safety throughout the request/response cycle.

## 3. Add server lifecycle management with proper state typing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement server state management system with typed states and transitions for MCP server lifecycle
### Details:
Define server states (initializing, ready, error, shutdown), implement state transition logic, add lifecycle event handlers, and ensure proper cleanup on shutdown.

## 4. Create typed client connection and session management [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Build client connection handling with session management and proper typing for connection states
### Details:
Implement connection pooling, session tracking, authentication handling, and connection state management with proper TypeScript typing for all connection-related operations.

## 5. Implement structured logging with typed log levels and context [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create comprehensive logging system with typed log levels, structured context, and MCP protocol-specific logging
### Details:
Define log level types, implement contextual logging with request/response correlation, add protocol-specific log formatters, and ensure proper log sanitization for sensitive data.

## 6. Add protocol compliance validation and error responses [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive protocol compliance checking and standardized error response handling
### Details:
Create protocol validation middleware, implement MCP-compliant error response formatting, add compliance testing utilities, and ensure all error scenarios return properly typed error responses.
