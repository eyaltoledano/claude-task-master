# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Security Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Add comprehensive security features including authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities.
# Details:
1. Implement proper authentication system
2. Add role-based access control (RBAC)
3. Implement input validation for all API endpoints
4. Add protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
5. Implement secure storage of sensitive configuration
6. Add proper data encryption for sensitive information
7. Implement rate limiting to prevent resource exhaustion
8. Add security headers to API responses

# Test Strategy:
Create security-focused tests for authentication and authorization. Use automated security testing tools (SAST/DAST). Test input validation with malicious payloads. Verify rate limiting works under load. Create penetration testing scenarios for common attack vectors.
