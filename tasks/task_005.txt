# Task ID: 5
# Title: Integrate Claude API
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Anthropic Claude API integration for AI-powered task generation
# Details:
Implement API authentication using the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable. Create a client for making requests to the Claude API. Implement configurable model selection using environment variables. Add error handling with exponential backoff for API failures. Implement response parsing and extraction. Create a caching mechanism to reduce API calls. Set up the environment variable handling for API configuration.

# Test Strategy:
Test API authentication with valid and invalid keys. Verify model selection works correctly. Test error handling by simulating API failures. Verify caching reduces duplicate API calls. Test with various prompt inputs and validate responses.
