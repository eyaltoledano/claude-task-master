# Task ID: 5
# Title: Convert Configuration Manager Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate configuration management system to TypeScript with strict typing for all configuration options
# Details:
Convert scripts/modules/config-manager to TypeScript with comprehensive type definitions for all configuration schemas. Implement configuration validation using TypeScript types and runtime checks. Add proper typing for environment variables, file-based configuration, and CLI options. Create type-safe configuration merging and validation logic. Implement configuration schema versioning with migration support.

# Test Strategy:
Test configuration loading and validation with various input scenarios. Verify type safety prevents invalid configurations. Test configuration merging logic preserves types. Validate that existing configuration files work without changes.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define comprehensive configuration type schema with all options typed [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create TypeScript interfaces and types for all configuration options, including nested structures, optional fields, and union types for different configuration modes
### Details:
Design complete type definitions covering all configuration categories (database, server, logging, features, etc.) with proper typing for primitives, objects, arrays, and enums. Include JSDoc comments for documentation.

## 2. Implement environment variable parsing with type coercion and validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build system to parse environment variables and convert them to appropriate types with validation against the schema
### Details:
Create parser that handles string-to-type conversion (boolean, number, array parsing), validates against schema constraints, and provides clear error messages for invalid values. Support nested object notation via dot notation or prefixes.

## 3. Add file-based configuration loading with JSON schema validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement configuration file loading supporting multiple formats (JSON, YAML, TOML) with schema validation
### Details:
Create file loaders for different formats, generate JSON schema from TypeScript types, validate loaded configuration against schema, and provide detailed validation error reporting with file location context.

## 4. Create type-safe configuration merging with proper precedence rules [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Build configuration merging system that combines multiple sources (defaults, files, env vars, CLI) with defined precedence and type safety
### Details:
Implement deep merging logic respecting precedence order (CLI > env vars > config files > defaults), handle array merging strategies, maintain type safety throughout merge process, and provide merge conflict resolution.

## 5. Implement configuration migration system for version compatibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.4
### Description: Create migration framework to handle configuration schema evolution and backward compatibility
### Details:
Build migration engine that can transform old configuration formats to new schemas, maintain migration history, provide rollback capabilities, and validate migrations. Include automated migration detection and user prompts for breaking changes.
