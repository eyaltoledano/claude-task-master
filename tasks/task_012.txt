# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Web UI for PRD Generation Workflow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a user-friendly web interface for the AI-driven PRD generation workflow that was ported from ChatPRD in Task #11.
# Details:
Develop a React-based UI for the PRD generation workflow that allows users to interact with the four main commands (ideate, round-table, refine-concept, generate-prd) through a web interface rather than just CLI. The implementation should:

1. Create a multi-step wizard interface that guides users through the PRD generation process
2. Design intuitive input forms for each step with appropriate validation
3. Show real-time progress/loading indicators during AI processing
4. Implement a dashboard to view and manage previously generated PRDs
5. Allow users to export PRDs in multiple formats (Markdown, PDF, HTML)
6. Include tooltips and help text to explain the purpose of each step
7. Ensure responsive design works on desktop and tablet devices
8. Add the ability to save drafts at any stage of the process
9. Implement proper error handling with user-friendly error messages
10. Use the existing service layer from Task #11 to handle the business logic

# Implementation Ideas for PRD Generation Web UI

## Architecture Approach
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separate frontend (React) from backend services
- **State Management**: Consider Redux or Context API for managing complex workflow state
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for each command with appropriate status codes

## UI/UX Design Concepts
- **Wizard Pattern Implementation**:
  - Step indicator showing all 4 phases (ideate → round-table → refine-concept → generate-prd)
  - Persistent navigation allowing users to move back/forth between completed steps
  - Collapsible sections for each completed step to review previous inputs

- **Progressive Disclosure**:
  - Show only relevant information at each step
  - Expandable help sections that don't overwhelm the interface

## Technical Components

### Frontend
- **React Component Structure**:
  ```
  App
  ├── Dashboard (PRD management)
  ├── WizardContainer
  │   ├── StepIndicator
  │   ├── IdeateStep
  │   ├── RoundTableStep
  │   ├── RefineConceptStep
  │   ├── GeneratePrdStep
  │   └── NavigationControls
  ├── PrdViewer
  └── ExportModule
  ```

- **Libraries to Consider**:
  - `react-hook-form` for form validation and management
  - `material-ui` or `chakra-ui` for component library
  - `react-markdown` for markdown preview
  - `react-pdf` for PDF generation
  - `react-query` for API state management and caching
  - `framer-motion` for smooth transitions between steps

### Progress Indicators
- Implement skeleton loaders during API calls
- Add progress bars with estimated completion time for longer processes
- Consider using WebSockets for real-time updates during lengthy AI processing

### Dashboard Features
- Sortable/filterable table of previous PRDs
- Preview cards with PRD thumbnails and key metadata
- Tagging system for categorization
- Search functionality across all PRDs

## Data Persistence
- Implement auto-save functionality (every 30 seconds)
- Use localStorage for draft caching to prevent data loss
- Create a dedicated "Drafts" section in the dashboard

## Export Functionality
- Server-side PDF generation for consistent formatting
- Client-side HTML/Markdown export for immediate access
- Consider adding export templates for different PRD styles

## Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

### Performance
- **Challenge**: AI processing may take significant time
- **Solution**: Implement background processing with webhook notifications when complete

### Complex State Management
- **Challenge**: Managing multi-step form data can become unwieldy
- **Solution**: Use form libraries with built-in state management or implement reducer pattern

### Error Handling
- **Challenge**: Various failure points in AI processing pipeline
- **Solution**: Implement retry mechanisms and clear error messages with recovery options

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for React components using Jest/React Testing Library
- Integration tests for multi-step workflows
- Usability testing with potential users to validate UX

## Alternative Approaches
- **Single Page vs. Multi-step**: Consider a single page interface with collapsible sections
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Add features for multiple users to collaborate on PRD creation
- **Template System**: Allow users to start from templates rather than always from scratch

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure keyboard navigation throughout the wizard
- Add ARIA attributes for screen readers
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for all UI elements

# Test Strategy:
Testing should cover both UI functionality and integration with the backend services:

1. Unit tests for all React components using Jest and React Testing Library
2. Integration tests that verify the correct API endpoints are called with expected parameters
3. End-to-end tests using Cypress that validate the complete PRD generation workflow
4. Usability testing with at least 3 different user personas (product manager, developer, designer)
5. Verify that the UI correctly handles API errors and displays appropriate messages
6. Test form validation for all input fields
7. Verify that loading states are correctly displayed during async operations
8. Test the export functionality for all supported formats
9. Verify that drafts can be saved and resumed correctly
10. Test the responsive design on various screen sizes
11. Verify that the UI state is consistent with the backend state after each operation
