# Task ID: 2
# Title: Refactor Codebase for Consistent Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Reorganize the codebase to follow a consistent architectural pattern with clear separation of concerns and standardized interfaces, using a hybrid approach combining hexagonal architecture with a simplified service layer.
# Details:
1. Analyze current code organization and identify inconsistencies
2. Define a hybrid architectural pattern combining hexagonal architecture with a simplified service layer
3. Create standardized module interface patterns
4. Extract common utilities to reduce duplication
5. Implement consistent naming conventions
6. Update imports and references to match new structure
7. Standardize CommonJS module patterns (instead of converting to ES modules)
8. Add proper TypeScript typing throughout the codebase
9. Create comprehensive documentation standards
10. Document all refactored modules according to the new standards

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for refactored modules. Ensure all existing tests pass with the new structure. Add integration tests to verify system behavior remains unchanged. Implement linting rules to enforce the new architectural patterns and documentation standards.
