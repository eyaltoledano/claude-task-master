# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Command Line Interface Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the CLI framework with command parsing and basic utilities
# Details:
Set up Commander.js for command parsing. Implement colorized console output using a library like chalk. Create help documentation for all commands. Add a configurable logging system with different verbosity levels. Implement the global options specified in the PRD (--help, --version, --file, --quiet, --debug, --json). Create the basic command structure following the PRD specifications.

# Test Strategy:
Test each command with various inputs including edge cases. Verify help documentation is comprehensive. Test logging at different verbosity levels. Ensure all global options work as expected.
