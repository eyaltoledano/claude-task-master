# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the core tasks.json structure and task model validation
# Details:
Create the foundational data structure for tasks.json that will serve as the single source of truth. Implement the Task model with all required fields (id, title, description, status, dependencies, priority, details, testStrategy, subtasks). Add validation logic to ensure data integrity. Implement basic file system operations for reading and writing tasks.json. Use JSON Schema for validation if appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Validate the task model against the specification in the PRD. Test reading/writing to tasks.json with various valid and invalid inputs. Ensure proper error handling for malformed data. Verify that all required fields are properly validated.
