# Task ID: 10
# Title: Update Package Configuration and Distribution
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Configure package.json and build system for TypeScript distribution while maintaining backward compatibility
# Details:
Update package.json with TypeScript build scripts, type definitions export, and proper main/types fields. Configure tsup for production builds with source maps and declaration files. Set up npm publishing workflow for compiled JavaScript with TypeScript declarations. Ensure bin/ directory points to compiled JavaScript files. Add proper package metadata for TypeScript support.

# Test Strategy:
Test package installation and usage in both JavaScript and TypeScript projects. Verify compiled output works correctly. Test CLI installation and execution. Ensure type definitions are properly exported and usable.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure package.json with proper main/types/exports fields [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up package.json with correct entry points, type definitions, and modern exports field for proper module resolution
### Details:
Configure main, types, exports, and files fields in package.json to ensure proper module resolution for both CommonJS and ESM environments. Set up conditional exports for different build targets.

## 2. Setup tsup production build with optimizations and tree-shaking [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Configure tsup build tool with production optimizations, tree-shaking, and multiple output formats
### Details:
Create tsup.config.ts with optimized settings for production builds including minification, tree-shaking, source maps, and multiple output formats (ESM, CJS). Configure external dependencies and bundle splitting.

## 3. Configure npm scripts for development, build, and release workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Set up comprehensive npm scripts for development workflow, production builds, and release automation
### Details:
Create npm scripts for dev, build, test, lint, clean, and release workflows. Include pre/post hooks for validation and cleanup. Set up watch mode for development and CI/CD integration scripts.

## 4. Update bin/ directory references to compiled output [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Modify binary executable references to point to compiled JavaScript output instead of TypeScript source
### Details:
Update package.json bin field and any CLI entry points to reference the compiled JavaScript files in the dist directory. Ensure proper shebang lines and executable permissions are maintained.

## 5. Add TypeScript declaration file generation and packaging [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.4
### Description: Configure automatic TypeScript declaration file generation and include them in the published package
### Details:
Set up TypeScript declaration file generation through tsup configuration. Ensure .d.ts files are properly generated, organized, and included in the published package. Configure declaration maps for better debugging experience.
