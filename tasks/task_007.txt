# Task ID: 7
# Title: Convert UI Components and CLI Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate user interface components and CLI interaction modules to TypeScript
# Details:
Convert scripts/modules/ui-components to TypeScript with proper typing for CLI interactions, prompts, and display formatting. Add type definitions for command-line arguments and options. Implement typed command handlers and validation. Add proper typing for terminal output formatting and color schemes. Ensure accessibility and internationalization support maintains type safety.

# Test Strategy:
Test CLI interface functionality with various input scenarios. Verify command parsing and validation work correctly. Test UI component rendering and formatting. Ensure backward compatibility with existing CLI usage patterns.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Type CLI argument definitions with yargs or commander types [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define TypeScript types for command-line argument parsing using yargs or commander.js, including option definitions, argument validation, and command structure typing
### Details:
Create type definitions for CLI commands, options, flags, and arguments. Implement proper typing for yargs/commander configuration objects, including validation schemas and help text generation.

## 2. Convert command handlers with proper input validation and typing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Transform existing command handlers to use TypeScript with comprehensive input validation, error handling, and type-safe parameter processing
### Details:
Refactor command handler functions to accept typed parameters from CLI parsing. Add runtime validation for user inputs, implement proper error handling with typed exceptions, and ensure type safety throughout command execution flow.

## 3. Add types for terminal output formatting and color utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement TypeScript types for terminal output formatting, including color schemes, text styling, progress indicators, and layout utilities
### Details:
Create type definitions for terminal color libraries (chalk, colors), text formatting options, progress bar configurations, table layouts, and other terminal UI components. Include types for ANSI escape sequences and terminal capability detection.

## 4. Implement typed prompt system for user interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Build a comprehensive typed prompt system for interactive user input, including various prompt types, validation, and response handling
### Details:
Create TypeScript interfaces for different prompt types (text, select, confirm, password). Implement typed validation functions, response parsing, and error handling. Include support for conditional prompts and multi-step user interactions with proper type flow.
