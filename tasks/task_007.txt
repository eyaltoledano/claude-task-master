# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Task Expansion with Claude
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add functionality to expand tasks into more detailed subtasks using AI
# Details:
Create subtask generation prompts following the template in the Appendix. Implement a workflow for expanding existing tasks with subtasks. Add context-aware expansion capabilities that consider the parent task and other related tasks. Implement parent-child relationship management in the task model. Ensure subtasks can be properly displayed, updated, and tracked in the CLI.

# Test Strategy:
Test subtask generation with various types of parent tasks. Verify parent-child relationships are maintained correctly. Test context-aware expansion with different contexts. Ensure CLI properly displays and manages subtasks.
