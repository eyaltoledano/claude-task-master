# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Performance Optimizations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize runtime performance, startup time, and resource utilization across the system.
# Details:
1. Optimize database queries with proper indexing
2. Add caching for expensive computations
3. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components
4. Optimize memory usage patterns to reduce garbage collection
5. Implement lazy initialization for non-critical services
6. Add parallel initialization for independent services
7. Implement proper connection pooling for external services
8. Optimize file I/O operations with buffering

# Test Strategy:
Create performance benchmarks to measure before/after improvements. Test memory usage patterns under load. Measure startup time improvements. Create load tests for optimized database queries. Test resource utilization under various conditions.
