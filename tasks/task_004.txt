# Task ID: 4
# Title: Improve AI Service Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance AI integration with support for multiple providers, caching, and context-aware prompts.
# Details:
1. Create an abstraction layer for AI service providers
2. Implement support for multiple AI providers beyond Claude
3. Add provider fallback mechanisms
4. Create a caching layer for AI responses to reduce API costs
5. Implement context-aware AI prompts that adapt based on task history
6. Add request batching for AI service calls
7. Implement proper error handling for AI service failures

# Test Strategy:
Create mock AI services for testing. Test fallback mechanisms by simulating provider failures. Verify cache effectiveness with repeated requests. Test context-awareness with various task histories. Measure performance improvements from request batching.
