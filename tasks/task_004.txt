# Task ID: 4
# Title: Migrate AI Provider Implementations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Convert AI provider modules to TypeScript with proper interface implementation and type safety
# Details:
Convert src/ai-providers/ modules to TypeScript, implementing the AIProvider interface. Add proper typing for API requests/responses, error handling, and configuration objects. Implement generic types for different AI provider responses. Add validation for external API data using type guards. Ensure proper async/await typing and Promise handling. Create factory pattern for provider instantiation with proper typing.

# Test Strategy:
Test that all AI providers implement the interface correctly. Verify API integration tests pass with TypeScript compilation. Test error handling and validation logic. Ensure provider factory creates correctly typed instances.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define base AIProvider interface and provider-specific response types [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational TypeScript interfaces and types for AI providers, including base provider interface, common response structures, and provider-specific response types
### Details:
Design abstract base class or interface for AI providers with common methods (generate, stream, etc.), define standardized response types, error types, and provider-specific response schemas for different AI services

## 2. Convert Anthropic provider with proper API typing and error handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Refactor the Anthropic provider implementation to use proper TypeScript typing, implement the base interface, and add comprehensive error handling
### Details:
Update Anthropic provider to implement base interface, add proper request/response typing for Claude API, implement retry logic, rate limiting, and specific error handling for Anthropic API responses

## 3. Convert OpenAI and Google providers following established patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Refactor OpenAI and Google providers to match the patterns established with the Anthropic provider conversion
### Details:
Apply the same interface implementation, typing patterns, and error handling established in the Anthropic conversion to OpenAI GPT and Google Gemini providers, ensuring consistency across implementations

## 4. Implement remaining providers (Ollama, OpenRouter, Perplexity, XAI) [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Create new provider implementations for the remaining AI services using the established patterns and interfaces
### Details:
Implement Ollama, OpenRouter, Perplexity, and XAI providers following the established interface patterns, including proper API integration, response typing, and error handling specific to each service

## 5. Create typed provider factory with configuration validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.4
### Description: Build a factory pattern for creating AI provider instances with proper configuration validation and type safety
### Details:
Implement a provider factory that validates configuration objects, creates appropriate provider instances based on type, includes configuration schema validation, and provides type-safe provider instantiation

## 6. Add comprehensive error handling with custom exception types [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.5
### Description: Implement a robust error handling system with custom exception types for different failure scenarios across all providers
### Details:
Create custom exception classes for different error types (API errors, rate limiting, authentication, network issues), implement error recovery strategies, add logging and monitoring capabilities, and ensure consistent error handling across all providers
