# Task ID: 4
# Title: Create Task File Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement generation of individual task files from tasks.json with bidirectional synchronization
# Details:
Create task file templates following the format in the PRD. Implement generation of individual task files from tasks.json. Add bidirectional synchronization to keep task files and tasks.json in sync. Implement proper file naming using the task ID (e.g., task_001.txt). Create a directory structure as specified in the PRD. Handle file system errors gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Verify task files are generated correctly from tasks.json. Test bidirectional sync by modifying task files and checking tasks.json updates. Test with various task states and ensure consistency between files and JSON.
