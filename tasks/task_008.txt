# Task ID: 8
# Title: Migrate CLI Entry Points and Scripts
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Convert main CLI entry points and initialization scripts to TypeScript
# Details:
Convert scripts/init.ts and scripts/dev.ts to TypeScript with proper command-line argument parsing and validation. Add type-safe process management and error handling. Implement proper typing for file system operations and project initialization. Add typed configuration for development mode and debugging. Ensure proper exit code handling and process cleanup.

# Test Strategy:
Test CLI entry points with various command combinations. Verify initialization process works correctly. Test development mode functionality. Ensure proper error handling and user feedback for invalid inputs.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Convert init.ts with typed project initialization flow [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Migrate the project initialization module to TypeScript with proper type definitions for configuration options, validation schemas, and initialization state management
### Details:
Add TypeScript interfaces for project configuration, initialization parameters, and validation rules. Implement typed error handling for initialization failures and provide comprehensive type safety for the project setup flow.

## 2. Migrate dev.ts with development mode configuration typing [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Convert the development mode module to TypeScript with typed configuration management, environment variable handling, and development server options
### Details:
Define TypeScript types for development configuration, hot reload settings, debugging options, and environment-specific parameters. Ensure type safety for development mode switches and configuration validation.

## 3. Implement typed process management and signal handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Add comprehensive TypeScript implementation for process lifecycle management, signal handling, and graceful shutdown procedures with proper type definitions
### Details:
Create typed interfaces for process events, signal handlers, and shutdown procedures. Implement proper TypeScript definitions for Node.js process APIs, signal management, and cleanup operations with error handling.

## 4. Add proper exit code handling and error reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Implement typed exit code management and comprehensive error reporting system with structured error types and proper process termination handling
### Details:
Define TypeScript enums for exit codes, error type hierarchies, and reporting interfaces. Implement typed error aggregation, logging, and process termination with proper cleanup and status reporting.
