# Task ID: 8
# Title: Add Implementation Drift Handling
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create functionality to update future tasks based on changes in implementation
# Details:
Implement capability to update future tasks based on implementation changes. Create task rewriting functionality using Claude API that considers new context. Implement dependency chain updates to ensure consistency when tasks change. Add functionality to preserve completed work while updating future tasks. Create a system to track and report implementation drift.

# Test Strategy:
Test updating future tasks with various implementation changes. Verify dependency chains remain valid after updates. Ensure completed work is preserved during updates. Test with complex task structures to verify system robustness.
