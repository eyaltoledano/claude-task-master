# Task ID: 3
# Title: Enhance Task Management Core Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement core task management enhancements including prioritization, dependencies, and versioning.
# Details:
1. Implement task prioritization system with configurable algorithms
2. Add support for task dependencies with cycle detection
3. Create task versioning and history tracking
4. Implement task templates for common workflows
5. Add task status transitions with validation
6. Create data models and database schema updates as needed
7. Implement proper indexing for efficient querying

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each new feature. Test edge cases like circular dependencies. Benchmark performance with large task sets. Create integration tests for the complete task lifecycle. Test database queries for efficiency.
