# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Basic Task Operations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create core task management functionality including listing, updating, and dependency tracking
# Details:
Implement task listing functionality with filtering options. Create task status update capability (pending/done/deferred). Add dependency tracking to ensure tasks are completed in the correct order. Implement priority management (high/medium/low). Add CRUD operations for tasks. Ensure all operations maintain data integrity and update the tasks.json file appropriately.

# Test Strategy:
Test each operation with various inputs. Verify dependency checking prevents invalid state transitions. Test priority assignment and filtering. Ensure all operations correctly update tasks.json.
