# Active Context & Current Focus

## Current Work Focus

### TASK001: MCP Provider Integration - COMPLETED ✅
Successfully implemented comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) provider support into Task Master's AI orchestration layer. The system can now act as an MCP client, using MCP servers as AI providers alongside existing direct API providers.

**Final Status**: All phases complete ✅
- ✅ **MCPAIProvider Class Created** (`src/ai-providers/mcp-provider.js`)
- ✅ **Provider Registry Updated** (`src/ai-providers/index.js`)
- ✅ **Unified Service Integration** (`scripts/modules/ai-services-unified.js`) 
- ✅ **Configuration Support Added** (models JSON, config validation)
- ✅ **Unit Tests Created** (25 passing tests)
- ✅ **Documentation Complete** (comprehensive guides and examples)

### CURRENT FOCUS: Enhanced Task Creation Features - TASK002 🔄
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete - Smart Dependency Detection Implemented ✅
**Priority**: High - Core enhancement to fix dependency auto-population issue

**Phase 1 Implementation Complete**: 
- ✅ Enhanced ContextGatherer with `includeAllTasksSummary` feature
- ✅ Comprehensive task overview generation (organized by status)
- ✅ Enhanced AI prompts with detailed dependency analysis guidelines
- ✅ Integration in add-task.js with improved context passing
- ⏳ **Next**: Testing, validation, and performance analysis

**Key Technical Achievement**: The AI now receives a complete overview of ALL tasks in the project (ID, title, description, dependencies, status) organized by completion status. This provides full project visibility for intelligent dependency detection while maintaining token efficiency through lightweight formatting.

**Expected Impact**: Dependency detection accuracy should improve from ~20% to >80%, significantly reducing manual post-creation updates.

### NEXT FOCUS: Enhanced Task Creation Features

## Recent Architectural Analysis

### Current AI Provider System
Task Master currently supports 10 AI providers through a unified `BaseAIProvider` pattern:
- **Anthropic** (Claude models)
- **OpenAI** (GPT models) 
- **Google** (Gemini models)
- **Vertex AI** (Google Cloud)
- **Azure OpenAI**
- **Amazon Bedrock**
- **xAI** (Grok models)
- **OpenRouter** (multiple model access)
- **Ollama** (local models)
- **Perplexity** (research-optimized)

### Provider Pattern Analysis
The existing system uses:
- **BaseAIProvider**: Abstract base class with `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject` methods
- **Provider Registry**: `PROVIDERS` object in `ai-services-unified.js`
- **Role-Based Selection**: main/research/fallback role assignment
- **Unified Service Runner**: `_unifiedServiceRunner` orchestrates provider calls with fallback logic

## Key Architectural Decisions

### MCP Integration Strategy
After analyzing the codebase, we've determined that MCP integration should follow the **provider pattern** rather than a separate service layer. This maintains consistency with the existing architecture and leverages proven patterns.

### Session vs. Client Context
The existing MCP server architecture in Task Master already handles session management and context passing. The new MCP provider will:
- Detect MCP context via session object presence
- Use MCP tools as the "API" instead of direct HTTP calls
- Leverage existing session-based API key resolution

### Configuration Approach
MCP provider configuration will integrate with the existing role-based system:
- **Provider Name**: "mcp" (following existing naming conventions)
- **Model ID**: Will map to MCP server/tool combinations
- **Authentication**: Will use existing session-based API key resolution
- **Base URL**: Not applicable (MCP uses session context)

## Implementation Plan Overview

### Phase 1: Core MCP Provider Implementation
1. **Create MCPAIProvider class** (`src/ai-providers/mcp-provider.js`)
   - Implement BaseAIProvider interface
   - Handle MCP session detection and validation
   - Map AI operations to MCP tool calls

2. **Update Provider Registry** (`src/ai-providers/index.js`)
   - Add MCPAIProvider export
   - Update unified service runner to include MCP provider

3. **Registry Integration** (`scripts/modules/ai-services-unified.js`)
   - Add MCP provider to PROVIDERS object
   - Ensure session-based context detection

### Phase 2: Configuration Integration
1. **Configuration Manager Updates** (`scripts/modules/config-manager.js`)
   - Add MCP provider validation
   - Implement MCP-specific configuration handling
   - Update API key resolution for MCP context

2. **Model Configuration Support**
   - Add MCP models to supported models list
   - Enable role-based MCP provider assignment
   - Support MCP provider in model selection commands

### Phase 3: Session Handling & Context
1. **Session Context Detection**
   - Implement MCP session validation
   - Handle MCP-specific error conditions
   - Ensure proper context passing

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Map generateText to appropriate MCP tools
   - Handle MCP-specific response formats
   - Implement proper error handling and fallback

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
1. **Unit Tests**
   - MCPAIProvider class tests
   - Integration tests with existing fallback logic
   - Session context validation tests

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Configuration guide updates
   - MCP provider usage examples
   - Architecture documentation updates

## Current Challenges & Considerations

### Technical Challenges
1. **Context Bridging**: Ensuring MCP session context is properly passed through all layers
2. **Tool Mapping**: Mapping abstract AI operations to specific MCP tools
3. **Error Handling**: MCP-specific error conditions and fallback behavior
4. **Session Lifecycle**: Managing MCP session state and cleanup

### Design Decisions Pending
1. **Model ID Format**: How to represent MCP server/tool combinations as model IDs
2. **Tool Selection**: Which MCP tools map to which AI operations
3. **Error Recovery**: How MCP provider failures should trigger fallback chains
4. **Configuration Scope**: Whether MCP provider needs special configuration handling

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Complete Memory Bank Update**: Finish documenting current state and implementation plan
2. **Begin MCPAIProvider Implementation**: Start with basic class structure and interface compliance
3. **Session Context Integration**: Implement MCP session detection and validation logic
4. **Provider Registry Updates**: Add MCP provider to existing registry system

### Success Criteria
- MCP provider integrates seamlessly with existing provider pattern
- Role-based assignment works for MCP provider (main/research/fallback)
- Existing fallback logic continues to work with MCP as an option
- Session-based context passing works correctly
- Unit tests validate all integration points

## Dependencies & Blockers

### No Current Blockers
The existing architecture is well-suited for this integration. The provider pattern provides clear extension points, and the session-based context system already handles MCP-style environments.

### Dependencies
- Existing BaseAIProvider interface (stable)
- MCP session management in unified service runner (stable)
- Configuration manager provider validation (stable)
- Provider registry pattern (stable)

## Context for Future Sessions

This implementation follows the established **provider pattern** used throughout Task Master's AI integration. The MCP provider will be a first-class citizen alongside other providers, supporting role-based assignment and intelligent fallback chains.

The key insight is that MCP integration doesn't require a separate architecture - it's simply another provider type that happens to use session context and tool calls instead of HTTP APIs. This maintains consistency and leverages all existing infrastructure for configuration, fallback, retry logic, and error handling.
