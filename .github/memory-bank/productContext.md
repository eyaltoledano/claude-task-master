# Product Context

## Why Task Master Exists

Task Master was created to solve a fundamental problem in AI-driven development: the disconnect between high-level requirements and actionable implementation tasks. Traditional project management tools focus on tracking and collaboration, but they don't understand the technical nuances of software development or integrate naturally with AI coding workflows.

## Core Problems We're Solving

### The Implementation Drift Problem
When developers discover better architectural approaches during implementation, they often continue without updating future tasks. This leads to:
- Tasks based on outdated assumptions
- Wasted effort on deprecated approaches  
- Inconsistent architecture across the codebase
- Lost context for future developers

Task Master addresses this by providing mechanisms to propagate architectural changes through the entire task hierarchy.

### The Granularity Gap
Product requirements are typically too high-level for immediate implementation, while manually breaking them down is:
- Time-consuming and error-prone
- Inconsistent in depth and quality
- Difficult to maintain dependency relationships
- Hard to update when requirements change

Task Master uses AI to intelligently break down requirements while maintaining logical dependency relationships.

### AI Context Integration
Modern AI coding assistants are powerful but lack project-specific context:
- They don't understand current project state
- They can't see task dependencies and priorities
- They lack access to project-specific research and decisions
- They can't maintain consistency across development sessions

Task Master provides rich, structured context that AI tools can consume via both CLI and MCP protocols.

## How Task Master Works

### The PRD-First Approach
1. **Start with Requirements**: Input a Product Requirements Document
2. **AI-Powered Parsing**: Claude or other AI models analyze and break down requirements
3. **Intelligent Task Generation**: Create structured tasks with dependencies, priorities, and acceptance criteria
4. **Continuous Refinement**: Update and expand tasks based on new insights and research

### Multi-Modal AI Integration
- **Generation**: Create new tasks from prompts with automatic dependency detection
- **Expansion**: Break complex tasks into manageable subtasks
- **Research**: Incorporate external research into task planning and implementation details
- **Updates**: Propagate changes through dependent tasks when approaches evolve

### Context-Rich Development
- **Rich Task Context**: Each task includes detailed implementation guidance, test strategies, and dependency information
- **AI-Consumable Format**: Tasks are available as both JSON data and markdown files optimized for AI consumption
- **Session Continuity**: Maintain project state across development sessions and team handoffs

## User Experience Goals

### For Individual Developers
- **Faster Onboarding**: Understand project structure and next steps immediately
- **Clear Direction**: Always know what to work on next and why
- **Rich Context**: Access detailed implementation guidance and research for each task
- **Flexible Access**: Use via command line, IDE integration, or AI coding assistants

### For AI-Driven Development
- **Contextual Awareness**: AI tools understand current project state and goals
- **Dependency Intelligence**: AI can reason about task relationships and blocking issues
- **Research Integration**: Fresh external knowledge is automatically incorporated
- **Consistency**: AI maintains architectural coherence across all tasks

### For Project Evolution
- **Adaptive Planning**: Tasks evolve as understanding improves
- **Impact Analysis**: Understand how changes affect dependent tasks
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Capture and maintain project decisions and research
- **Architectural Coherence**: Ensure all tasks align with current technical approach

## Target Workflows

### New Project Setup
1. Create PRD with technical requirements and architectural decisions
2. Parse PRD to generate initial task hierarchy
3. Review and refine generated tasks
4. Begin implementation with rich context for each task

### Feature Development
1. Add new feature requirements to PRD or as direct task prompts
2. Generate feature-specific tasks with dependency analysis
3. Use research tools to incorporate current best practices
4. Implement with AI assistants that have full project context

### Architectural Evolution
1. Discover better approaches during implementation
2. Update relevant tasks with new technical decisions
3. Propagate changes to all dependent tasks
4. Maintain consistency across the entire project

### AI-Assisted Implementation
1. AI coding assistant queries current task details
2. Assistant understands dependencies, acceptance criteria, and implementation notes
3. Implementation proceeds with full project context
4. Progress updates maintain accurate project state

## Success Indicators
