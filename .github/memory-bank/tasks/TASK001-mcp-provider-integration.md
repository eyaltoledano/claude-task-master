# [TASK001] - MCP Provider Integration

**Status:** Completed ✅  
**Added:** 2025-01-26  
**Updated:** 2025-06-16

## Original Request
Integrate MCP (Model Context Protocol) provider support into Task Master's AI orchestration layer, enabling the system to act as an MCP client and use MCP servers as AI providers alongside existing direct API providers.

## Thought Process
After comprehensive analysis of the existing AI provider architecture, we determined that MCP integration should follow the established **provider pattern** rather than creating a separate service layer. This approach:

1. **Maintains Architectural Consistency**: Uses the same BaseAIProvider interface and patterns as existing providers
2. **Leverages Existing Infrastructure**: Utilizes current session management, fallback logic, and configuration systems
3. **Enables Role-Based Assignment**: Allows MCP to be used for main/research/fallback roles like other providers
4. **Preserves Unified Interface**: Keeps the same API surface for all AI operations

Key insight: MCP integration is essentially another provider type that uses session context and tool calls instead of direct HTTP APIs. This maintains consistency while leveraging all existing infrastructure.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core MCP Provider Implementation
1. **Create MCPAIProvider Class** (`src/ai-providers/mcp-provider.js`)
   - Extend BaseAIProvider with MCP-specific implementation
   - Implement `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject` methods
   - Handle MCP session detection and validation
   - Map AI operations to appropriate MCP tool calls

2. **Update Provider Registry** (`src/ai-providers/index.js`)
   - Add MCPAIProvider export
   - Update provider imports

3. **Registry Integration** (`scripts/modules/ai-services-unified.js`)
   - Add MCP provider to PROVIDERS object
   - Ensure session-based context detection works correctly

### Phase 2: Configuration Integration
1. **Configuration Manager Updates** (`scripts/modules/config-manager.js`)
   - Add MCP provider to validation logic
   - Implement MCP-specific configuration handling
   - Update API key resolution for MCP context
   - Add MCP to supported providers list

2. **Model Configuration Support**
   - Add MCP models to MODEL_MAP in supported-models.json
   - Enable role-based MCP provider assignment
   - Support MCP provider in `task-master models` command

### Phase 3: Session Handling & Context
1. **Session Context Detection**
   - Implement robust MCP session validation
   - Handle MCP-specific error conditions  
   - Ensure proper context passing through all layers

2. **Tool Integration**
   - Map `generateText` to appropriate research/text generation tools
   - Map `streamText` to streaming-capable MCP tools (if available)
   - Map `generateObject` to structured output tools
   - Implement proper error handling and response parsing

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
1. **Unit Tests**
   - MCPAIProvider class functionality tests
   - Integration tests with existing fallback logic
   - Session context validation tests
   - Error handling and edge case tests

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Configuration guide updates for MCP provider
   - MCP provider usage examples and best practices
   - Architecture documentation updates
   - Troubleshooting guide for MCP-specific issues

All core functionality is implemented, tested, and documented.

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Approach
- **Provider Pattern**: Use existing BaseAIProvider pattern rather than separate integration
- **Session Detection**: Leverage existing session-based context detection in unified service runner
- **Configuration Integration**: Use existing role-based configuration system
- **Error Handling**: Utilize existing fallback chain and retry logic

### Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental Integration**: Add MCP provider without disrupting existing functionality
- **Interface Consistency**: Maintain exact same API surface as other providers
- **Session Context**: Use MCP session object for context and tool access
- **Tool Mapping**: Map abstract AI operations to specific MCP tool calls

### Configuration Design
- **Provider Name**: "mcp" (following existing naming conventions)
- **Model IDs**: Will represent MCP server/tool combinations
- **Authentication**: Session-based API key resolution (existing pattern)
- **Role Assignment**: Support for main/research/fallback roles

## Success Criteria
- ✅ MCP provider integrates seamlessly with existing provider pattern
- ✅ Role-based assignment works for MCP provider (main/research/fallback)
- ✅ Existing fallback logic continues to work with MCP as an option
- ✅ Session-based context passing works correctly
- ✅ Unit tests validate all integration points
- ✅ Documentation clearly explains MCP provider usage

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Dependencies**: Existing BaseAIProvider interface (stable), MCP session management (stable)
- **Risks**: Low risk - following established patterns with proven architecture
- **Blockers**: None identified - existing architecture well-suited for this integration
