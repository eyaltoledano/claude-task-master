# Task Master Generate PRD Implementation Timeline

## Initial Research & Planning - [Date]
- Analyzed GitHub issue #37 for requirements: https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master/issues/37
- Reviewed existing command structure in scripts/modules/commands.js
- Explored PRD creator reference: https://github.com/JeredBlu/custom-instructions/blob/main/prd-creator-3-25.md
- Identified key components needed:
  - ideate: Convert idea into structured product concept (concept.txt)
  - round-table: Simulate expert discussion for improvements (discussion.txt) 
  - refine-concept: Apply refinements to concept
  - generate-prd: Generate full PRD (prd.txt)

## Project Setup - [Date]
- Explored repository structure to understand current implementation
- Identified relevant modules:
  - commands.js: CLI command registration
  - task-manager.js: Core business logic for task management
  - ai-services.js: AI interaction services
  - ui.js: User interface components
- Established implementation approach following commands.mdc guidelines
- Created implementation-plan.md with detailed feature requirements and command structure

## Implementation Plan - [Date]
1. Create command structure in commands.js following existing patterns
2. Implement core PRD generation logic in task-manager.js
3. Add AI interaction methods in ai-services.js
4. Create UI components for interactive prompts
5. Test and refine implementation
6. Update documentation

## Development Progress - [Current Date]
- Received Anthropic API key for development
- Added AI service functions to ai-services.js:
  - generateProductConcept(): Converts idea to structured concept
  - generateExpertDiscussion(): Simulates round table discussion
  - generateConceptRefinement(): Applies refinements to concept
  - generatePRD(): Creates final PRD document
- Added core business logic to task-manager.js:
  - ideateProductConcept(): Handles idea to concept process including file I/O
  - simulateRoundTable(): Manages round table discussion and file I/O
  - refineProductConcept(): Handles concept refinement
  - generatePRDFile(): Creates PRD from concept
  - generatePRDWorkflow(): Manages entire end-to-end workflow
- Added CLI commands to commands.js:
  - generate-prd: Main command with complete workflow
  - ideate: Standalone concept generation
  - round-table: Standalone discussion simulation
  - refine-concept: Standalone concept refinement
  - generate-prd-file: Standalone PRD generation
- Updated documentation in dev_workflow.mdc with command references
- Improved cross-platform compatibility:
  - Replaced Unix-specific `chmod` command in package.json with Node.js-based implementation that works on both Unix and Windows systems
  - This ensures the installation process works seamlessly across different operating systems

## Next Steps - [Planned Date]
1. Manual testing of each command
2. End-to-end workflow testing
3. Adding example template in scripts directory
4. Creating example output for README.md
5. Potential improvements:
   - Enhanced template support
   - Better validation for file inputs
   - More options for research integration

## Notes
- Need to implement according to guidelines in commands.mdc
- Must follow Task Master's eslogan: clear, simple, and concise
- All interactions will be in English, even though we're discussing in Spanish
- Local task-master will be used for testing during development
