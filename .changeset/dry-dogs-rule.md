Add new `task-master start` command for automated task execution with Claude Code

- You can now start working on tasks directly by running `task-master start <task-id>` which will automatically launch Claude Code with a comprehensive prompt containing all task details, implementation guidelines, and context.
- `task-master start` will automatically detect next-task when no ID is provided.
