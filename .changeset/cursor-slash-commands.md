Add Cursor IDE custom slash command support

When users add the Cursor profile, they now get all 47 Task Master commands available as native Cursor slash commands (/tm/add-task, /tm/next-task, /tmshow-task, etc.) with automatic distribution and cleanup via the rule-transformer system. Also improves profile summary accuracy to show total files processed including custom commands. Provides full parity to Claude Code slash commands.
