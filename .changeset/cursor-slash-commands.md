Adds Cursor IDE custom slash command support with full parity to Claude Code slash commands. When users add the Cursor profile, they now get all 47 Task Master commands available as native Cursor slash commands (/tm-add-task, /tm-next-task, /tm-show-task, etc.) with automatic distribution and cleanup via the rule-transformer system.
