Enhanced Gemini CLI provider with codebase-aware task generation

Added automatic codebase analysis for Gemini CLI provider in parse-prd, and analyze-complexity, add-task, udpate-task, update, update-subtask commands
When using Gemini CLI as the AI provider, Task Master now instructs the AI to analyze the project structure, existing implementations, and patterns before generating tasks or subtasks
Tasks and subtasks generated by Claude Code are now informed by actual codebase analysis, resulting in more accurate and contextual outputs
