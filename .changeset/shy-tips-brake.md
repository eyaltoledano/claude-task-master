Add "Start Task" button to VS Code extension for seamless Claude Code integration

You can now click a "Start Task" button directly in the Task Master extension which will open a new terminal and automatically execute the task using Claude Code. This provides a seamless workflow from viewing tasks in the extension to implementing them without leaving VS Code.
