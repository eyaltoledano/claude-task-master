Enhanced Claude Code provider with codebase-aware task generation

- Added automatic codebase analysis for Claude Code provider in `parse-prd`, `expand-task`, and `analyze-complexity` commands
- When using Claude Code as the AI provider, Task Master now instructs the AI to analyze the project structure, existing implementations, and patterns before generating tasks or subtasks
- Tasks and subtasks generated by Claude Code are now informed by actual codebase analysis, resulting in more accurate and contextual outputs
