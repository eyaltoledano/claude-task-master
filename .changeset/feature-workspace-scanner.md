Add workspace scanner feature for generating tasks from existing codebases. The feature includes a CLI command and MCP tool that analyze code to automatically generate a PRD and create structured tasks based on that PRD. The workspace scanner integrates with the existing parse-prd automation chain for a seamless workflow.
