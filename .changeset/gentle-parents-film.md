This change significantly enhances the `add-task` command's intelligence. When you add a new task, Taskmaster now automatically:
    - Analyzes your existing tasks to find those most relevant to your new task's description.
    - Provides the AI with detailed context from these relevant tasks.

This results in newly created tasks being more accurately placed within your project's dependency structure, saving you time and any need to update tasks just for dependencies, all without significantly increasing AI costs. You'll get smarter, more connected tasks right from the start.
