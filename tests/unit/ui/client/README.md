# Kanban Board Frontend Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for the Kanban board frontend structure, focusing on testing requirements rather than implementation.

## Test Files

### 1. `kanban-structure.test.js`
**HTML Structure Tests**

Tests the required HTML structure for the Kanban board:
- Main container structure with proper semantic markup
- 5 columns: Backlog, Ready, In Progress, Review, Done
- Task card structure with headers, body, and footer
- Interactive elements (buttons, menus)
- Loading and empty states
- Accessibility attributes and ARIA labels

### 2. `kanban-styling.test.js`
**CSS Styling Requirements Tests**

Validates styling requirements for:
- Grid layout system (5 columns on desktop)
- Responsive breakpoints and adaptations
- Typography and spacing standards
- Column-specific color schemes
- Interactive states (hover, focus, drag)
- Dark mode and accessibility support
- Animation and transition requirements

### 3. `kanban-javascript.test.js`
**JavaScript Initialization Tests**

Tests JavaScript functionality requirements:
- Module loading and initialization
- Event listener setup for drag & drop
- API integration patterns
- Task management functions
- State management
- Error handling
- DOM manipulation methods
- Keyboard navigation support

### 4. `kanban-responsive.test.js`
**Responsive Design Tests**

Covers responsive design requirements:
- Viewport and meta tag requirements
- Breakpoint definitions (desktop >1200px, tablet 768-1200px, mobile ≤768px)
- Touch device optimizations
- Performance considerations
- Orientation handling
- Media query support (print, dark mode, reduced motion)
- Accessibility in responsive design

### 5. `kanban-accessibility.test.js`
**Accessibility Requirements Tests**

Comprehensive accessibility testing for:
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- ARIA labels and semantic markup
- Keyboard navigation patterns
- Screen reader support
- Focus management
- Color contrast requirements
- Assistive technology support
- Live regions and announcements

### 6. `index.test.js`
**Test Suite Overview**

Meta-tests that validate:
- Test coverage completeness
- Quality assurance standards
- Technology constraints
- Performance requirements
- Browser compatibility
- Documentation standards

## Technology Requirements

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no build tools)
- **Testing**: Jest with ES modules support
- **Server**: Express.js serving static files
- **Environment**: Node.js 18+ with experimental VM modules

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all frontend tests
node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/.bin/jest tests/unit/ui/client/

# Run specific test file
node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/.bin/jest tests/unit/ui/client/kanban-structure.test.js

# Run with coverage
node --experimental-vm-modules ./node_modules/.bin/jest tests/unit/ui/client/ --coverage
```

## Key Features Tested

### Core Structure
- 5-column Kanban layout
- Drag and drop functionality
- Task card management
- Real-time updates

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Adaptive layouts
- Performance optimization

### Accessibility
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation
- ARIA compliance
- High contrast support

### User Experience
- Intuitive interactions
- Visual feedback
- Error handling
- Loading states

## Test Quality Standards

- **Isolation**: Each test is independent with proper setup/teardown
- **Mocking**: DOM APIs and external dependencies are mocked
- **Coverage**: All major functionality areas are tested
- **Documentation**: Clear, descriptive test names and comments
- **Maintainability**: Reusable patterns and helper functions

## Frontend Constraints

The tests validate that the implementation adheres to these constraints:
- No build tools or transpilation
- No JavaScript frameworks
- Pure vanilla HTML/CSS/JS
- Static file serving only
- Modern browser compatibility

## Implementation Guidance

These tests serve as specifications for implementing the Kanban board. Key requirements:

1. **HTML Structure**: Must include all tested elements and attributes
2. **CSS Grid**: 5-column layout with responsive breakpoints
3. **JavaScript**: Event-driven architecture with proper error handling
4. **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
5. **Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices and slow connections

## File Structure Expected

```
src/ui/client/
├── index.html          # Main HTML structure
├── styles/
│   ├── main.css        # Core styles
│   ├── responsive.css  # Media queries
│   └── accessibility.css # A11y overrides
└── scripts/
    ├── kanban.js       # Main application logic
    ├── drag-drop.js    # Drag and drop handling
    └── api.js          # API integration
```

The tests validate requirements for this structure without requiring the actual implementation files to exist.
