# Expert Round Table Discussion: Task Management System for Software Development

## Participants
- Senior Software Engineer (SSE)
- Product Manager (PM)
- UX Designer (UXD)
- QA Specialist (QA)

## Discussion Summary

**PM**: Thank you all for joining this discussion about our proposed task management system for software development teams. Let's start by discussing what you see as the core strengths and weaknesses of the concept.

**SSE**: I appreciate the focus on Git integration and CLI interface. Most developers would find that very natural to their workflow. However, I'm concerned about how the dependency tracking will actually work in practice. Will it analyze code dependencies automatically or just rely on manual linking?

**UXD**: The dashboard functionality sounds promising, but we need to be careful about information overload. I've seen many tools that provide too much data without actionable insights. I think we should focus on simplifying the visualization while still conveying the critical information.

**QA**: From my perspective, I'd like to see more details about how testing tasks integrate with development tasks. Often QA work is treated as an afterthought in these systems. Also, how will the system handle tasks that span multiple sprints?

**PM**: Those are excellent points. I also think we should consider the onboarding experience more carefully. The success of this tool will depend on team adoption, and if it's too complex to set up or learn, teams might resist using it.

## Key Recommendations

1. **Dependency Management Enhancement** (SSE)
   - Implement both manual and automatic dependency detection
   - Provide visual warnings for circular dependencies
   - Allow different dependency types (blocks, informs, relates to)

2. **Simplified Dashboard Views** (UXD)
   - Create role-specific dashboard views (developer, manager, QA)
   - Implement progressive disclosure of information
   - Add customizable widgets for different metrics

3. **QA Integration Improvements** (QA)
   - Add test case linking to development tasks
   - Include test coverage metrics in task completion criteria
   - Implement test failure notifications linked to relevant tasks

4. **Adoption and Onboarding Focus** (PM)
   - Create interactive tutorials for new users
   - Provide templates for common development workflows
   - Implement gradual feature introduction

5. **Cross-Platform Consistency** (All)
   - Ensure command syntax is consistent across platforms
   - Maintain visual consistency between CLI and GUI interfaces
   - Implement cloud sync for offline work situations

## Conclusion

The concept has strong potential but would benefit from these refinements. Particularly important is balancing the power of integration with ease of use, and ensuring all team roles (not just developers) find value in the system. The next iteration should address these concerns while maintaining the core value proposition.
