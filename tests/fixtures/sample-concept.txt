# Task Management System for Software Development

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive task management system designed specifically for software development teams to track, prioritize, and manage tasks throughout the development lifecycle. The system integrates with development tools and provides real-time updates on task status and dependencies.

## Problem Statement
Software development teams struggle with tracking task dependencies, visualizing project progress, and managing shifting priorities. Existing task management tools lack deep integration with development workflows and don't provide sufficient visibility into how tasks impact each other.

## Target Audience
- Software development teams (5-20 developers)
- Engineering managers and team leads
- Product managers
- QA and testing teams

## Proposed Solution
Create a specialized task management system that integrates directly with development tools (Git, IDEs), automatically tracks task progress based on code commits, and provides visualization of dependencies and blockers.

## Key Features
1. Git integration for automatic status updates
2. Dependency tracking and visualization
3. Priority management with conflicts detection
4. Time tracking and estimation tools
5. Dashboard for team progress and individual workloads
6. Integration with popular IDEs
7. Command-line interface for developer-friendly interaction

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in blocked tasks by 40%
- 30% decrease in time spent on status updates
- 25% improvement in meeting delivery deadlines
- User satisfaction rating of 4.5/5 or higher

## Constraints
- Must work with multiple Git providers (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
- Should operate in environments with limited connectivity
- Must maintain data privacy and security
- Should work across different operating systems
