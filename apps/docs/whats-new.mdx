## Latest Improvements

### Enhanced Monorepo Support

Task Master now provides improved support for monorepos and multi-project setups:

- **Smart Project Root Detection**: When running commands from subdirectories, Task Master now prioritizes `.taskmaster` directories in parent folders over other project markers (like `.git`, `package.json`, etc.)
- **Unified Task Management**: A single `.taskmaster` at the monorepo root can now manage tasks across multiple sub-repositories
- **Consistent Behavior**: All team members see the same tasks regardless of which package directory they're working in

This enables seamless task management in complex project structures where you might have multiple packages, services, or applications under a single task management system.

**Example**: In a monorepo with `/project/.taskmaster` and `/project/packages/frontend/.git`, running `task-master list` from the frontend package will correctly use the root `.taskmaster` instead of treating the frontend as a separate project.
