## Version 0.31.1

### ZAI Coding Plan Support
Task Master now supports ZAI (GLM) models with two separate providers based on your subscription:

- **zai**: Standard ZAI endpoint (`https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/`)
- **zai-coding**: Coding Plan endpoint (`https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4/`)

Both providers use the same model IDs (glm-4.6, glm-4.5) but route to different API endpoints. When running `task-master models --setup`, you'll see both providers listed separately, allowing you to choose the appropriate one for your subscription.

### Improved Auto-Update Experience
Updates now happen automatically before your CLI commands run and automatically restart to execute your command with the new version. No more manual restarts needed!

## Version 0.31.0

### Custom OpenAI-Compatible Providers
Connect Task Master to any service that implements the OpenAI API specification:

```bash
task-master models --set-main llama-3-70b --openai-compatible --baseURL http://localhost:8000/v1
```

### Native Z.ai (GLM) Support
Access high-performance Chinese models including GLM-4.6 with massive 200K+ token context windows at competitive pricing.
