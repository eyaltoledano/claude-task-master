### Remote Task Updates (API Storage Support)

Task Master now supports remote task processing through API storage integration:

- **Automatic Detection**: System automatically detects storage type and routes operations accordingly
- **Remote AI Processing**: When using API storage, task updates are processed by remote Hamster AI services
- **Seamless Interface**: CLI and MCP interfaces remain consistent regardless of storage backend
- **Hybrid Capability**: Projects can use either file-based (local) or API-based (remote) storage

**Key Features:**
- Zero configuration required - automatic detection and routing
- `update-task` and `update-subtask` commands work identically in both storage modes
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing projects
- Bridge architecture ensures smooth migration path from legacy code
