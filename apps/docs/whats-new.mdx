## ðŸŽ‰ New: Claude Code Plugin Support

Task Master AI now supports Claude Code plugins with modern marketplace distribution!

### What's New

- **49 slash commands** with clean naming (`/taskmaster:command-name`)
- **3 specialized AI agents** (task-orchestrator, task-executor, task-checker)
- **MCP server integration** for deep Claude Code integration

### Installation

```bash
/plugin marketplace add eyaltoledano/claude-task-master
/plugin install taskmaster@taskmaster
```

### Migration for Existing Users

The `rules add claude` command no longer copies files to `.claude/` directories. Instead:

- Shows plugin installation instructions
- Only manages CLAUDE.md imports for agent instructions
- Directs users to install the official plugin

If you previously used `rules add claude`:

1. Old commands in `.claude/commands/` will continue working but won't receive updates
2. Install the plugin for latest features: `/plugin install taskmaster@taskmaster`
3. Remove old `.claude/commands/` and `.claude/agents/` directories

### Why This Change?

Claude Code plugins provide:

- âœ… Automatic updates when we release new features
- âœ… Better command organization and naming
- âœ… Seamless integration with Claude Code
- âœ… No manual file copying or management

The plugin system is the future of Task Master AI integration with Claude Code!
