Before you can start using TaskMaster AI, you'll need to install Node.js. Depending on your workflow choice, you may also need AI model API keys.

## Workflow Options

**Solo Workflow (Local)**: Requires Node.js + AI API Keys  
**Team Workflow (Hamster)**: Requires Node.js + Hamster account (no API keys needed)

## 1. Node.js

TaskMaster AI is built with Node.js and requires it to run. npm (Node Package Manager) comes bundled with Node.js.

### Installation

**Option 1: Download from official website**
1. Visit [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version for your operating system
3. Run the installer and follow the setup wizard

**Option 2: Use a package manager**

<CodeGroup>

```bash Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install nodejs
```

```bash Windows (winget)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. AI Model Setup

### For Solo Workflow (Local)

Taskmaster utilizes AI across several commands, and those require a separate API key. For the purpose of a Quick Start we recommend setting up an API Key with Anthropic for your main model and Perplexity for your research model (optional but recommended).

<Tip>Task Master shows API costs per command used. Most users load $5-10 on their keys and don't have to top it off for a few months.</Tip>

At least one (1) of the following is required:

1. Anthropic API key (Claude API) - **recommended for Quick Start**
2. OpenAI API key
3. Google Gemini API key
4. Perplexity API key (for research model)
5. xAI API Key (for research or main model)
6. OpenRouter API Key (for research or main model)
7. Claude Code (no API key required - requires Claude Code CLI)

### For Team Workflow (Hamster)

When using Hamster integration, you don't need any AI API keys. Hamster provides all AI inference through their platform.

**What you need:**
1. **Hamster Account**: Sign up at [hamster.ai](https://hamster.ai) 
2. **Internet Connection**: Required for real-time team sync
3. **Team Members** (optional): Invite teammates via email during brief creation

**Benefits of Hamster Workflow:**
- ✅ No API key management required
- ✅ Real-time team collaboration  
- ✅ Centralized task storage
- ✅ Built-in AI inference
- ✅ Shared context across team members

You can always switch between workflows or use both depending on your project needs.
