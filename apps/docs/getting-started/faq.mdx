## MCP Connection Issues

### "Server does not support completions" Error

If you're encountering connection failures with MCP clients (especially Cursor IDE) showing errors like "Server does not support completions", this indicates a capability negotiation issue.

**Solution**: Update to the latest version of Task Master AI, which includes compatibility fixes for modern MCP clients.

```bash
npm update -g task-master-ai
```

This issue was resolved in recent releases through:
- Upgraded fastmcp library with enhanced MCP protocol support
- Improved compatibility with Cursor IDE and other MCP clients
- Better capability negotiation handling

If you continue to experience issues after updating, please:
1. Restart your MCP client (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
2. Verify your `.mcp.json` configuration
3. Check the MCP server logs for detailed error messages
