## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### MCP Connection Issues

**Problem**: MCP client shows "Server does not support completions (required for completion/complete)" error

**Solution**: This issue has been resolved in Task Master v0.32.1 and later. Make sure you're using the latest version:

```bash
# Update to the latest version
npm install -g task-master-ai@latest

# Or for MCP usage
npx -y task-master-ai@latest
```

If you're still experiencing issues, try:

1. **Restart your editor** after updating
2. **Check your MCP configuration** includes the correct server name and arguments
3. **Verify API keys** are properly configured in your environment

**Problem**: "0 tools enabled" in MCP settings

**Solution**: 
1. Ensure at least one API key is configured in your MCP server environment
2. Restart your editor after adding API keys
3. Check that the server name matches exactly in your configuration

### Installation Issues

**Solution**: 
```bash
# Verify installation
npm list -g task-master-ai

# Re-install if needed
npm uninstall -g task-master-ai
