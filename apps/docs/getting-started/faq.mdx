## Common Questions

### How do I get more detailed error information?

Enable debug mode by setting the `DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
DEBUG=true task-master <command>
```

This shows full error messages, stack traces, and additional context. See our [Troubleshooting guide](/getting-started/troubleshooting) for complete details.

### Why are my commands failing silently?

Task Master uses sanitized error messages by default to provide a clean user experience. Enable debug mode to see technical details about what went wrong.

### How do I report a bug?

When reporting issues, please:
1. Enable debug mode and include the full error output
2. Provide your environment details (OS, Node.js version, Task Master version)
3. Include the command that failed and your project configuration

See our [Troubleshooting guide](/getting-started/troubleshooting) for complete bug reporting guidelines.
