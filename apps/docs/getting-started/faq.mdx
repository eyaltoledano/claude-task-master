## 🔐 Authentication Issues

### "Your session has expired. Please log in again with: task-master login"

This error occurs when your authentication token has expired or become invalid. This is normal behavior for security reasons. To resolve:

```bash
task-master login
```

If you continue having issues, you can also try:

```bash
task-master logout
task-master login
```

### Debugging Authentication Problems

If you're experiencing authentication issues, enable debug mode to see detailed error information:

```bash
DEBUG=true task-master login
```

This will show stack traces and detailed error messages that can help identify the issue.

### MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Issues

Task Master supports MFA-enabled accounts. If you have MFA enabled:

1. The `task-master login` command will automatically handle the MFA flow
2. Follow the prompts to complete your MFA verification
3. Your session will remain valid until it expires
