# Authentication & Storage Modes

Task Master supports two storage modes: **local file storage** and **remote storage via Hamster**. Understanding the differences helps you choose the right mode for your workflow.

## Storage Modes

### Local File Storage (Default)

When using local file storage:
- Tasks are stored in `.taskmaster/tasks/tasks.json` 
- You have full control over dependency management
- AI model configuration is managed locally
- All commands are available
- Works offline once configured

### Remote Storage (Hamster)

When authenticated with Hamster:
- Tasks are synchronized with remote servers
- Hamster manages dependencies automatically
- AI model configuration is handled by Hamster
- Some local-only commands are blocked
- Requires internet connectivity

## Authentication Commands

```bash
# Log in to Hamster (enables remote storage)
task-master auth login

# Log out from Hamster (returns to local storage)  
task-master auth logout

# Check authentication status
task-master auth status
```

## Local-Only Commands

The following commands are **only available in local storage mode**. They will be blocked when authenticated with Hamster:

### Dependency Management
- `task-master add-dependency`
- `task-master remove-dependency` 
- `task-master validate-dependencies`
- `task-master fix-dependencies`

### Subtask Management
- `task-master clear-subtasks`

### Configuration
- `task-master models` (Hamster manages AI models automatically)

## Switching Between Modes

You can switch between local and remote storage at any time:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Switch to Remote (Hamster)
# Log in to enable remote storage and sync
task-master auth login
```

```bash Switch to Local  
# Log out to return to local file storage
task-master auth logout
```
</CodeGroup>

## When to Use Each Mode

### Use Local Storage When:
- Working offline or with limited connectivity
- Need full control over dependencies and model configuration
- Developing or testing Task Master itself
- Working on sensitive projects that can't use remote services

### Use Remote Storage (Hamster) When:
- Want automatic dependency management
- Working in teams with shared task synchronization
- Prefer managed AI model configurations
- Need access to additional Hamster features

## Command Blocking Messages

When you try to use a local-only command while authenticated with Hamster, you'll see helpful messages like:

```
╭─ Hamster Manages Dependencies ─────────────────────────────╮
│                                                            │
│  Hamster handles dependencies for the "My Project" Brief.  │
│  To manage dependencies manually, log out with tm auth     │
│  logout and work locally.                                  │
│                                                            │
│  Switch between local and remote workflows anytime by     │
│  logging in/out.                                          │
╰────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Simply run `task-master auth logout` to access these commands in local mode.
