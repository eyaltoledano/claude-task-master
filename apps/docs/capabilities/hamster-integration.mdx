Task Master integrates seamlessly with Hamster, a team collaboration platform for AI-driven development. This integration enables you to move from solo development with local tasks to collaborative team workflows.

## Overview

Hamster integration offers two key benefits:

1. **Team Collaboration**: Share your task plans with teammates through collaborative briefs
2. **No API Keys Required**: Hamster handles all AI inference, removing the need to manage your own API keys

## Workflow Options

When you run `task-master init`, you can choose between two workflows:

### Solo Workflow (Taskmaster)
- Parse PRD → structured tasks → AI agent executes with local control
- Tasks stored locally in JSON files
- Requires your own AI API keys
- Great for individual development and prototyping

### Team Workflow (Hamster)
- Team writes brief → Hamster refines → aligned execution with Taskmaster
- Tasks live in cloud with real-time sync
- No API keys needed - Hamster provides AI inference
- Enables team collaboration and shared context

## Getting Started with Hamster

### 1. Authentication

First, login to Hamster to enable team features:

```bash
# OAuth login flow
task-master login

# For SSH/remote environments, use token-based login
task-master login <your-token>

# Check authentication status
task-master auth status
```

### 2. Create Team Briefs

You have several options for creating collaborative briefs:

#### From PRD (Parse to Hamster)
```bash
# Parse PRD directly to Hamster instead of local tasks
task-master parse-prd your-prd.md --hamster
```

This will:
- Create a new brief on Hamster with auto-generated title/description
- Generate tasks on the platform (no local JSON files)
- Show progress with real-time updates
- Allow you to invite teammates during creation
- Set your CLI context to the new brief

#### Export Existing Tasks
```bash
# Export all local tasks to a new Hamster brief
task-master export

# Export specific tags
task-master export frontend,backend

# Export and invite team members
task-master export --invite teammate1@company.com,teammate2@company.com
```

The export process:
- Reverse-engineers your PRD from existing tasks
- Creates a comprehensive brief with context
- Imports all tasks atomically
- Provides shareable URLs for team collaboration

## Team Collaboration Features

### Invite Team Members

During brief creation, you can invite up to 10 teammates:

```bash
# Using the --invite flag
task-master export --invite user1@example.com,user2@example.com

# Or use the short form
task-master export -I user1@example.com,user2@example.com
```

The system will show invitation status:
- ✅ Invitation sent successfully
- ✅ User is already a team member  
- ❌ Error sending invitation

### Real-time Sync

When connected to Hamster:
- Tasks sync in real-time across your team
- Changes made by teammates appear instantly
- Context is shared and maintained across the team
- All team members see the same task state

### Contextual UI

Task Master automatically detects Hamster connection and provides context-aware UI:

- Shows `Brief: [name]` instead of `tag: [name]`
- Displays Hamster-specific command help
- Progress indicators for cloud operations
- Clickable URLs for brief and team invites

## Command Reference

### Authentication Commands
```bash
task-master login [token]           # Login to Hamster
task-master logout                  # Logout from Hamster  
task-master auth status             # Check auth status
```

### Brief Management
```bash
task-master parse-prd <file> --hamster    # Create brief from PRD
task-master export [tags]                 # Export tasks to brief
task-master export --invite <emails>      # Export with team invites
task-master export --dry-run              # Preview export
```

### Task Operations
All standard Task Master commands work with Hamster briefs:
```bash
task-master list                    # List brief tasks
task-master next                    # Get next task
task-master status <id> <status>    # Update task status
task-master update-task <id> <text> # Update with AI (via Hamster)
```

## Privacy and Telemetry

When using Hamster integration:

- **Data Location**: Tasks and briefs are stored securely on Hamster's platform
- **AI Processing**: All AI operations are handled by Hamster's infrastructure
- **Telemetry**: Anonymous usage telemetry is collected to improve the service
- **Opt-out**: You can disable telemetry with `anonymousTelemetry: false` in config

## Best Practices

### When to Use Hamster
- **Team Projects**: When collaborating with multiple developers
- **Client Work**: When you need to share progress and context
- **API Key Management**: When you want to avoid managing multiple AI API keys
- **Real-time Collaboration**: When team members need synchronized task updates

### When to Use Solo Workflow  
- **Personal Projects**: Individual development work
- **Prototyping**: Quick experimentation and iteration
- **Sensitive Code**: When you need complete local control
- **Custom AI Setup**: When you have specific AI model preferences

### Migration Between Workflows

You can easily move between workflows:

1. **Solo → Team**: Use `task-master export` to move local tasks to Hamster
2. **Team → Solo**: Download tasks from Hamster brief and import locally (coming soon)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Clear auth cache and re-login
task-master logout
task-master login

# Check authentication status
task-master auth status
```

### Sync Issues
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Check Hamster service status
- Re-authenticate if needed

### API Key Conflicts
When using Hamster, you don't need local AI API keys. If you have both configured, Hamster takes precedence for team briefs.
