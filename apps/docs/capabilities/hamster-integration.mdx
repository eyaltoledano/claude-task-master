# Team Collaboration with Hamster

Task Master now integrates seamlessly with Hamster to enable team-based project management and AI-powered task execution. This integration lets you move beyond solo development to true collaborative workflows.

## Overview

The Hamster integration transforms Task Master from a solo tool into a team platform:

- **Shared Context**: Your entire team works from the same brief, ensuring alignment
- **No API Keys**: Hamster handles all AI operations, removing setup friction
- **Real-time Sync**: Tasks and updates sync across all team members instantly
- **Collaborative Planning**: Write and refine briefs together, then generate tasks

## Getting Started with Hamster

### 1. Initialize with Team Workflow

When you run `task-master init`, choose the **"Together (Hamster)"** workflow:

```bash
task-master init
```

This will:
- Skip local AI model configuration (Hamster handles this)
- Set up OAuth authentication with Hamster
- Configure your project for team collaboration

### 2. Authentication

Use the built-in authentication commands:

```bash
# Log in to Hamster
task-master login

# Log out of Hamster  
task-master logout
```

## Working with Briefs

### Creating Briefs from PRDs

When you parse a PRD with Hamster integration, your document becomes a collaborative brief:

```bash
task-master parse-prd .taskmaster/docs/feature.md
```

Choose **"Bring it to Hamster"** and the system will:

1. **OAuth Login**: Authenticate with your Hamster account
2. **Brief Creation**: Convert your PRD into a structured brief
3. **Team Invites**: Optionally invite teammates during creation
4. **Task Generation**: Generate tasks with progress indicators
5. **Context Setting**: Automatically set your CLI context to the new brief

### Brief Features

- **Auto-generated titles and descriptions** from your PRD content
- **Progress tracking** during task generation phases
- **Clickable URLs** for easy access to briefs and team invites
- **Real-time collaboration** with your entire team

## Exporting Local Tasks to Team

Already have local tasks? Export them to create collaborative briefs:

```bash
# Export all local tasks to Hamster
task-master export

# Export and invite team members
task-master export --invite

# Export specific tags
task-master export --tags=feature,bug-fix
```

The export process:
- **Reverse engineers** your PRD from existing tasks
- **Creates collaborative brief** with auto-generated content
- **Invites team members** (up to 10 via email)
- **Syncs your context** to the new team brief

## Enhanced User Experience

### Hamster-Aware Commands

When connected to Hamster, Task Master provides optimized experiences:

- **Context-specific help**: Shows only relevant commands for team workflows
- **Progress indicators**: Loading spinners for long-running operations
- **Better displays**: Shows "Brief: [name]" instead of "tag: [name]"
- **Simplified updates**: Cleaner update displays without redundant info

### Improved Command Syntax

All the new positional argument syntax works seamlessly with Hamster:

```bash
# Set task status with new syntax
task-master status HAM-31 done
task-master status ham31.2 in-progress

# Update tasks with natural syntax
task-master update-task HAM-31 Added authentication logic

# List tasks by status
task-master list done
task-master list in-progress
```

### Task ID Flexibility

Hamster task IDs work naturally with case-insensitive matching:

```bash
# All of these work the same way
task-master show HAM-31
task-master show ham31
task-master show ham-31
```

## Team Benefits

### Alignment
- **Single source of truth**: Everyone works from the same brief
- **Shared context**: Team members see the same task breakdown
- **Coordinated execution**: No duplicate work or conflicting implementations

### Collaboration  
- **Real-time updates**: Changes sync across all team members
- **Team invites**: Easy onboarding of new members
- **Collective intelligence**: Leverage team knowledge in task generation

### Simplified Setup
- **Zero API keys**: No individual API key management
- **Centralized AI**: Hamster handles all AI operations
- **Instant start**: New team members can start immediately

## Best Practices

### Brief Writing
- **Write collaboratively**: Use Hamster's brief editing to refine together
- **Include context**: More team context leads to better task generation
- **Define responsibilities**: Clarify who owns what parts of the brief

### Task Management
- **Regular syncs**: Use `task-master next` to stay aligned on priorities
- **Status updates**: Keep task statuses current for team visibility
- **Communication**: Use brief comments for coordination

### Workflow Integration
- **Branch alignment**: Create branches that match task assignments
- **PR references**: Reference Hamster task IDs in pull requests
- **Review coordination**: Coordinate code reviews through brief discussions

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Check your internet connection
- Ensure you have a valid Hamster account
- Try `task-master logout` then `task-master login` to refresh

### Sync Problems
- Verify you're connected to the correct brief
- Check that all team members are using the same brief context
- Contact your team admin if brief permissions are restricted

### Performance
- Use `task-master list` filters to focus on relevant tasks
- Consider organizing large briefs with clear task hierarchies
- Break down complex briefs into multiple focused ones

## Migration from Solo to Team

Already using Task Master solo? Here's how to migrate:

1. **Export existing tasks**: `task-master export --invite`
2. **Invite your team**: Add team members during export
3. **Switch context**: Your CLI automatically switches to the team brief
4. **Coordinate**: Share the brief URL with your team
5. **Continue working**: Use the same Task Master commands with team sync

The migration preserves all your task structure while adding team collaboration capabilities.
