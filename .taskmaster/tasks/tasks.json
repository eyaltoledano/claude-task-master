say command, Linux espeak/festival)\n- Create TTS configuration options in the configuration management system\n- Add voice selection options (male/female, different languages if available)\n- Implement audio output settings (volume, speed, pitch)\n- Add TTS-specific error handling for cases where TTS is unavailable\n- Create fallback behavior when TTS fails (silent failure or text output)\n- Support for reading task titles, descriptions, and status updates aloud\n- Add option to read entire task lists or individual task details\n- Implement TTS for command confirmations and error messages\n- Create TTS output formatting to make spoken text more natural (removing markdown, formatting numbers/dates appropriately)\n- Add configuration option to enable/disable TTS globally\n<info added on 2025-06-14T21:55:53.499Z>\nAdd comprehensive testing strategy for TTS functionality:\n\n**TTS Testing Requirements:**\n- Test TTS flag functionality across all commands (list, show, generate) with various voice configurations\n- Validate TTS engine integration on different platforms (Windows SAPI, macOS say, Linux espeak/festival)\n- Test voice selection options and audio output settings (volume, speed, pitch) with edge cases\n- Verify TTS error handling when engines are unavailable or fail\n- Test fallback behavior scenarios (silent failure vs text output)\n- Validate TTS output formatting for natural speech (markdown removal, number/date pronunciation)\n- Test global TTS enable/disable configuration settings\n- Verify TTS works correctly with task titles, descriptions, and status updates of varying lengths and complexity\n- Test TTS performance with large task lists and individual task details\n- Validate TTS for command confirmations and error messages across different error scenarios\n\n**Automated TTS Test Cases:**\n- Enable TTS flag and verify audio output generation without errors\n- Test each supported TTS engine with fallback when primary engine fails\n- Validate configuration persistence for TTS settings across application restarts\n- Test TTS with special characters, long text, and multilingual content\n- Verify TTS integration doesn't interfere with normal command execution or file operations\n- Test concurrent TTS operations and resource management\n- Validate TTS accessibility compliance and user experience consistency\n</info added on 2025-06-14T21:55:53.499Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-14T22:07:04.840Z>\n**Duplicate Save Prevention Testing for TTS Implementation:**\n\nSince TTS functionality involves configuration persistence and potential concurrent operations, implement specific tests to prevent duplicate saves in the TTS context:\n\n- Test TTS configuration saves to prevent duplicate entries in configuration files when users rapidly change voice settings, volume, or other audio parameters\n- Validate that TTS engine initialization doesn't create duplicate configuration entries when switching between different TTS engines (Windows SAPI, macOS say, Linux espeak)\n- Test concurrent TTS operations to ensure audio output settings aren't duplicated when multiple commands with --tts flag run simultaneously\n- Verify that TTS preference saves are atomic and don't result in corrupted or duplicate configuration data during rapid user interactions\n- Implement unique constraint checks for TTS configuration entries to prevent duplicate voice profiles or audio settings\n- Test TTS configuration persistence across application restarts to ensure settings aren't duplicated on reload\n- Validate that TTS error logging doesn't create duplicate log entries when TTS engines fail or fallback mechanisms activate\n- Test edge cases where users rapidly toggle global TTS enable/disable settings to prevent duplicate configuration states\n- Ensure TTS-related task metadata (like audio output preferences per task) doesn't create duplicate entries in tasks.json\n- Implement locking mechanisms for TTS configuration file operations to prevent race conditions during concurrent access\n\nThis testing should be integrated with the existing TTS test strategy to ensure robust duplicate prevention across all TTS-related save operations.\n</info added on 2025-06-14T22:07:04.840Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-14T22:08:10.995Z>\n**Claude API Integration Testing for TTS Commands:**\n\nAdd specific testing requirements for Claude API integration within the TTS implementation context:\n\n- Test Claude API connectivity when generating TTS-enabled task content to ensure API calls don't interfere with audio output generation\n- Validate Claude API authentication and error handling when TTS commands request AI-generated content with --tts flag enabled\n- Test Claude API response parsing and integration with TTS output formatting to ensure AI-generated text is properly converted for speech synthesis\n- Verify Claude API token usage tracking doesn't conflict with TTS configuration persistence mechanisms\n- Test concurrent operations where Claude API calls and TTS audio generation occur simultaneously\n- Validate Claude API retry and backoff logic works correctly when TTS commands fail and need to regenerate content\n- Test Claude API integration with task generation workflows that include TTS output requirements\n- Ensure Claude API error messages are properly formatted for TTS output when --tts flag is enabled\n- Test Claude API model parameter configuration persistence alongside TTS configuration settings\n- Validate that Claude API failures gracefully fallback without breaking TTS functionality for existing task content\n- Test environment variable handling for ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in conjunction with TTS engine configuration\n- Verify Claude API integration logging doesn't create conflicts with TTS error logging mechanisms\n\nThis testing should ensure seamless integration between Claude API functionality and TTS features without interference or duplicate save issues.\n</info added on 2025-06-14T22:08:10.995Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-14T22:10:22.106Z>\n**Final Duplicate Save Testing Protocol - Research Session 6/14/2025:**\n\n**Comprehensive Test Environment Setup:**\n- Create clean test environment with known state of tasks.json and TTS configuration files\n- Back up current tasks.json, TTS settings, and Claude API configuration before testing\n- Ensure all TTS engines and Claude API connectivity are functional for comprehensive testing\n\n**Duplicate Save Test Scenarios for TTS Implementation:**\n- Test saving TTS configuration with identical voice settings to verify no duplicate entries\n- Attempt simultaneous TTS configuration saves while audio output is active\n- Test Claude API task generation with --tts flag to ensure no duplicate task entries in tasks.json\n- Validate TTS preference persistence doesn't create duplicate configuration entries during rapid setting changes\n- Test concurrent TTS operations with multiple commands to verify no duplicate audio output settings\n- Simulate race conditions between TTS configuration saves and Claude API calls\n\n**Manual and Automated Test Execution:**\n- Execute TTS commands with --tts flag while monitoring tasks.json for duplicate entries\n- Test Claude API integration with TTS-enabled commands to verify single task creation\n- Validate TTS configuration file integrity after multiple rapid setting changes\n- Test TTS error logging to ensure no duplicate log entries during engine failures\n- Verify TTS-related task metadata saves don't create duplicate entries\n\n**Edge Case Testing for TTS Context:**\n- Test TTS configuration saves with minor variations (case sensitivity, whitespace) in voice names\n- Validate duplicate detection with similar TTS settings across different engines\n- Test large-scale TTS operations to ensure performance and correctness\n- Verify TTS global enable/disable toggle doesn't create duplicate configuration states\n\n**Validation and Documentation:**\n- Monitor TTS configuration files, tasks.json, and logs for any duplicate entries\n- Document test results in provided table format with TTS-specific scenarios\n- Verify error handling provides clear feedback for TTS-related duplicate save attempts\n- Confirm regression testing covers all TTS functionality without introducing new duplicate save issues\n- Complete stakeholder confirmation before closing duplicate save testing for TTS implementation\n</info added on 2025-06-14T22:10:22.106Z>",
