# Test Calculator Library PRD

## Overview
Create a simple calculator library to test the TDD autopilot workflow. This will demonstrate the complete RED-GREEN-COMMIT cycle with proper test coverage.

## Features

### 1. Basic Arithmetic Operations
Implement core mathematical operations:
- Addition: Add two numbers
- Subtraction: Subtract one number from another
- Multiplication: Multiply two numbers
- Division: Divide one number by another with proper error handling

### 2. Advanced Operations
Implement additional mathematical functions:
- Power: Calculate x raised to the power of y
- Square root: Calculate the square root of a number
- Modulo: Calculate remainder of division

### 3. Input Validation
Ensure robust error handling:
- Validate numeric inputs
- Handle division by zero
- Handle invalid operations
- Provide meaningful error messages

### 4. Calculation History
Track calculation history:
- Store last 10 calculations
- Retrieve calculation history
- Clear history
- Export history as JSON

## Technical Requirements

- TypeScript implementation
- 100% test coverage for all operations
- Follow TDD workflow strictly
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type-safe interfaces

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All arithmetic operations return correct results
2. Division by zero throws appropriate error
3. Invalid inputs are rejected with clear error messages
4. History tracking works correctly with max 10 entries
5. All public methods have corresponding tests
6. Code passes TypeScript strict mode
