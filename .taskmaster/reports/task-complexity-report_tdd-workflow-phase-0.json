			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Create autopilot command CLI skeleton",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the autopilot command creation into: 1) Create AutopilotCommand class extending Commander.Command with proper argument parsing and options, 2) Implement command structure with help text and validation following existing patterns, 3) Add basic registration method and placeholder action handler",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity due to following established patterns in the codebase. The command-registry.ts and start.command.ts provide clear templates for implementation. Main complexity is argument parsing and option validation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement preflight detection system",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create PreflightChecker with these subtasks: 1) Package.json test script detection and validation, 2) Git working tree status checking using system commands, 3) Tool availability validation (git, gh, node/npm), 4) Default branch detection via git commands, 5) Structured result reporting with success/failure indicators and error messages",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to system integration requirements. Needs to interact with multiple external tools (git, npm, gh), parse various file formats, and handle different system configurations. Error handling for missing tools adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement task loading and validation",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement task loading: 1) Use existing TaskService from @tm/core to load tasks by ID with proper error handling, 2) Validate task structure including subtask existence and dependency validation, 3) Provide user-friendly error messages for missing tasks or need to expand subtasks first",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity. While leveraging existing TaskService reduces implementation effort, the validation logic for subtasks and dependencies requires careful handling of edge cases. Task structure validation adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create execution plan display logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Build ExecutionPlanDisplay: 1) Create display formatter using boxen and chalk for consistent CLI styling, 2) Format preflight check results with color-coded status indicators, 3) Display subtask execution order with RED/GREEN/COMMIT phase visualization, 4) Show branch/tag info and finalization steps with duration estimates",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to complex formatting requirements and dependency on multiple other components. The display needs to coordinate information from preflight, task validation, and execution planning. CLI styling consistency adds complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement branch and tag planning",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create BranchPlanner: 1) Implement branch name generation using pattern <tag>/task-<id>-<slug> with kebab-case conversion and special character handling, 2) Add TaskMaster config integration to determine active tag and handle existing branch conflicts",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity. String manipulation and naming convention implementation is straightforward. The main complexity is handling edge cases with special characters and existing branch conflicts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create subtask execution order calculation",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement dependency resolution: 1) Build dependency graph from subtask data with proper parsing, 2) Implement topological sort algorithm for execution order, 3) Add circular dependency detection with clear error reporting, 4) Create parallel execution grouping for independent subtasks",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to graph algorithms and dependency resolution. Topological sorting, circular dependency detection, and parallel grouping require algorithmic sophistication. Edge cases in dependency chains add significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement TDD phase planning for subtasks",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create TDDPhasePlanner: 1) Implement test file path detection for common project structures (src/, tests/, __tests__), 2) Parse implementation files from subtask details and descriptions, 3) Generate conventional commit messages for RED/GREEN/COMMIT phases, 4) Add implementation complexity estimation based on subtask content",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to project structure detection and file path inference. Conventional commit message generation and complexity estimation require understanding of different project layouts and parsing subtask content effectively."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add finalization steps planning",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create FinalizationPlanner: 1) Implement test suite execution planning with coverage threshold detection from package.json, 2) Add git operations planning (branch push, PR creation) using existing git patterns, 3) Create duration estimation algorithm based on subtask count and complexity metrics",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity. Building on existing git utilities and test command detection reduces complexity. Main challenges are coverage threshold parsing and duration estimation algorithms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate command with existing CLI infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Complete CLI integration: 1) Add AutopilotCommand to command-registry.ts following existing patterns and update command metadata, 2) Test command registration and help system integration with proper cleanup and error handling",
			"reasoning": "Low-medium complexity. The command-registry.ts provides a clear pattern to follow. Main work is registration and ensuring proper integration with existing CLI infrastructure. Well-established patterns reduce complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Add comprehensive error handling and edge cases",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement error handling: 1) Add missing task and invalid task structure error handling with helpful messages, 2) Handle git state errors (dirty working tree, missing tools), 3) Add dependency validation errors (circular, invalid references), 4) Implement missing tool detection with installation guidance, 5) Create user-friendly error messages following existing CLI patterns",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive error scenarios. Each component (preflight, task loading, dependency resolution) has multiple failure modes that need proper handling. Providing helpful error messages and recovery suggestions adds complexity."
