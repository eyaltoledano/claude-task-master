			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Add getNextTasks method to TaskService",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "This is a foundational method addition. Implement the method signature with proper TypeScript typing, add JSDoc documentation following existing patterns, and ensure it throws NotImplementedError initially.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity task involving basic method addition with signature and documentation. No complex logic required, just following existing patterns and ensuring TypeScript compilation."
		},

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement concurrency parameter validation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement comprehensive validation including type checking, bounds validation (>=1), max value clamping (<=10) with warning logging, and proper error messages using existing error handling patterns.",
			"reasoning": "Low to moderate complexity validation logic. While it involves multiple validation rules and error scenarios, they are standard patterns. The warning mechanism adds slight complexity but overall remains straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement core concurrent task selection algorithm",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break this down into: 1) Filter eligible tasks based on status, 2) Implement two-phase selection logic (subtasks from in-progress parents first), 3) Apply priority sorting and limit selection to concurrency. Each subtask should be tested independently.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity algorithmic implementation involving multiple phases, priority sorting, dependency tracking, and business logic. The two-phase selection and priority sorting add significant complexity that benefits from being broken down."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement dependency validation between selected tasks",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Implement dependency ID normalization to full dotted notation, 2) Create validation algorithm that checks cross-type dependencies and ensures no circular references. Include comprehensive testing for mixed task/subtask scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to cross-type dependency handling and normalization requirements. The O(n²) algorithm with edge cases for mixed dependencies benefits from being separated into normalization and validation phases."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Add --concurrency flag to CLI NextCommand",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Add the CLI flag following existing Commander.js patterns, update the options interface, and ensure proper help text. Verify flag accepts both short (-c) and long (--concurrency) formats.",
			"reasoning": "Very low complexity standard CLI flag addition. Following existing patterns makes this straightforward boilerplate work with minimal logic involved."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Update CLI command to call new core method",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Implement conditional logic to route to getNextTasks() when concurrency > 1, otherwise use existing getNextTask(). Ensure backward compatibility and that all existing flags (--tag, --format, --silent, --project) work with both paths.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to branching logic and backward compatibility requirements. The routing logic is cohesive and should be implemented together to ensure all paths work correctly."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Update NextTaskResult interface and data flow",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Update the interface to add tasks array and taskCount fields while keeping existing task field for compatibility. Modify result creation logic to populate all fields correctly based on the number of tasks returned.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity mainly around backward compatibility. The interface changes and data population are tightly coupled and should be implemented together to ensure consistency."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Update text output for multiple tasks",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Modify displayResults to handle multiple tasks with numbered headers, separators, and count display. Ensure single task display remains unchanged for backward compatibility. Focus on clear formatting and consistent styling.",
			"reasoning": "Low to moderate complexity presentation layer changes. The formatting logic is cohesive and should be implemented as a single unit to ensure consistent output."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Support JSON output for multiple tasks",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "Update JSON formatter to include tasks array and taskCount while maintaining existing structure. Ensure backward compatibility by keeping all existing fields and populating them appropriately for 0, 1, and multiple task scenarios.",
			"reasoning": "Low to moderate complexity similar to task 8 but for JSON output. The structure changes are cohesive and should be implemented together to ensure consistent API contract."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Handle edge cases and add comprehensive tests",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into: 1) Implement edge case handling logic for scenarios (no tasks, all completed, fewer than requested, etc.), 2) Add comprehensive test suite including unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests covering EC-001 to EC-006.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to breadth of coverage required. The implementation and testing phases are distinct and benefit from separation to ensure comprehensive coverage without mixing concerns."
