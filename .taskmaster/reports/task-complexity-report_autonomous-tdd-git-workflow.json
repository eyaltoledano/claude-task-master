			"taskTitle": "Create WorkflowOrchestrator Core Service",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the WorkflowOrchestrator implementation into: 1) Core state machine with phase transitions and event emission, 2) Workflow state persistence and checkpoint system, 3) Resume/pause functionality with state restoration, 4) Integration points for adapters (test runner, git, executors), 5) Progress event system with EventEmitter, 6) Error handling and recovery mechanisms. Each subtask should focus on a specific aspect of the orchestrator.",
