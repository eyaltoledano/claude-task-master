			"taskId": 105,
			"taskTitle": "Add command-based key resolution in utils.js",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Generate 4-6 subtasks to implement command-based key resolution in scripts/modules/utils.js: add timeout parsing helper, extend resolveEnvVariable to detect '!cmd:' and route to executor, implement executeCommandForKey using execSync with /bin/sh and sanitized error handling, ensure backward compatibility for non-prefixed values, and add focused unit tests with mocked execSync covering success/timeout/empty output/errors. Include acceptance criteria for each subtask.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate implementation with careful timeout parsing, synchronous process execution, sanitized logging, and backward compatibility; unit tests straightforward but require execSync mocking."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 106,
			"taskTitle": "Implement session cache for command results",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Propose 5-7 subtasks to add an in-process command result cache in scripts/modules/utils.js: introduce module-level Map with TTL helpers and enable/disable flags, refactor core execution into a cache-agnostic function, wrap with cache lookup/set logic keyed by keyName+command, export clearCommandCache, and add unit tests using fake timers/Date.now spies to validate hits, expiry, disabled mode, and not caching null. Specify test setup/teardown and acceptance criteria.",
			"reasoning": "Requires refactor to separate core execution, correct TTL semantics, environment-based toggles, and comprehensive tests with timers; low external risk but multiple moving parts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 107,
			"taskTitle": "Add command validation and security hardening",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create 6-8 subtasks to add command validation: implement deny-list regex checks, optional allow-list prefix check (read from config when present), integrate validation into the '!cmd:' execution path prior to running commands, ensure sanitized errors (no command echo), and add unit tests that confirm blocking of dangerous patterns and honoring allow-list. Include documentation stubs or comments for future enterprise allow-list source. Define clear acceptance tests for each rule.",
			"reasoning": "Security-sensitive logic with nuanced regexes, correct placement in flow, configuration hook for allow-list, and strict log sanitization; higher review and testing rigor required."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 108,
			"taskTitle": "Add local config override support (.taskmaster/config.json)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into 5-7 subtasks: implement safe loader for .taskmaster/config.json with projectRoot resolution, integrate into resolveRawValue precedence without breaking existing sources, wire security.allowedCommandPrefixes to the validator, trigger clearCommandCache on reload/change, handle malformed JSON gracefully, and add unit tests using a temp project directory to verify precedence and hot reload behavior. State acceptance criteria for precedence and cache clearing.",
			"reasoning": "Touches config IO, precedence rules, cache invalidation, and security prefix plumbing; moderate complexity with edge cases (missing/malformed files, reloads)."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 109,
			"taskTitle": "Unit test suite for command execution and caching",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline 6-8 subtasks to build a comprehensive unit test suite: set up/confirm test runner (e.g., Jest) and mocks for node:child_process, write tests for '!cmd:' detection, success, empty output, non-command passthrough, timeout handling, error codes, caching behavior with TTL/disabled/clear, and sanitized logging. Include coverage targets (>90% for new logic) and guidance for environment isolation (process.env overrides).",
			"reasoning": "Broad test coverage with mocking, timers, and environment manipulation; set-up may be needed if runner/config arenâ€™t present."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 110,
			"taskTitle": "Integration tests for common credential store commands",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into 7-10 subtasks: implement opt-in integration test harness gated by ENABLE_SECRET_IT, detect CLI availability per provider, author test cases for echo baseline, macOS Keychain, pass, 1Password (when signed in), AWS, Azure, with safe ephemeral fixtures; add skip logic when tools/env missing; ensure sanitized logging and timeout handling; provide setup/teardown scripts; and document local prerequisites. Define acceptance criteria per provider and overall safety constraints (no real secrets).",
			"reasoning": "High variability across environments/CLIs, platform-specific behavior, ephemeral secret lifecycle, and robust skip/teardown logic; non-trivial to make reliable and safe."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 111,
			"taskTitle": "Cross-platform and CI integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Plan 5-7 subtasks: add CI matrix for macOS/Linux with Node LTS, split unit and optional integration jobs, ensure /bin/sh usage across runners and note WSL guidance, collect basic timing metrics for cache warm vs cold, document WSL instructions and limitations, and verify environment isolation (no secret injection). Provide acceptance criteria for green unit jobs on both OSes and conditional integration job execution.",
			"reasoning": "CI configuration and docs work with some platform nuances; moderate complexity coordinating matrix, conditional jobs, and documentation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 112,
			"taskTitle": "Documentation and examples update",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Propose 5-7 subtasks to update docs: add README section on '!cmd:' syntax with sanitized examples and env options, refresh .env.example with command-based patterns, update CLAUDE.md and .taskmaster/CLAUDE.md for dynamic keys, create docs/credential-management.md covering security/caching/deny-list/allow-list, and add troubleshooting and migration guidance. Include a doc review checklist and acceptance criteria (no secrets, links valid).",
			"reasoning": "Content-heavy changes across multiple files with consistency and safety requirements; coordination needed but technically straightforward."
