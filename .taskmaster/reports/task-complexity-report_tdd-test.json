			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down project setup into: 1) Create directory structure and package.json, 2) Configure TypeScript with tsconfig.json, 3) Set up Jest testing framework with ts-jest, 4) Initialize git repository and configure .gitignore",
			"reasoning": "Standard project setup with well-defined tooling. Moderate complexity due to multiple configuration files and tool integration, but follows established patterns."

			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Define Operation enum and core calculation types, 2) Create CalculationResult interface and CalculatorError class, 3) Define CalculationHistory interface with constraints and validation",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward TypeScript type definitions. Low-moderate complexity as it's mainly declarative code with clear requirements."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into TDD cycles: 1) Implement add() method with tests, 2) Implement subtract() method with tests, 3) Implement multiply() method with tests, 4) Implement divide() method with division-by-zero handling, 5) Implement input validation and error handling for all operations",
			"reasoning": "Core implementation requiring strict TDD discipline. Moderate-high complexity due to comprehensive testing, edge cases, and error handling requirements."

			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Implement power() method with negative/fractional exponent handling, 2) Implement sqrt() method with input validation for negative numbers, 3) Implement modulo() method with edge case handling, 4) Comprehensive testing for all advanced operations including mathematical edge cases",
			"reasoning": "Higher complexity due to mathematical edge cases (negative exponents, fractional powers, sqrt of negatives). Requires careful handling of mathematical domain restrictions."

			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure as: 1) Create validateNumber() private method with comprehensive type checking, 2) Implement validateOperation() for operand count validation, 3) Design specific error messages for each validation failure type, 4) Integration testing of validation across all calculator methods",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity with systematic validation requirements. Needs comprehensive error messaging and integration with existing operations."

			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement calculation history tracking (TDD)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Add history array property and basic addToHistory() method, 2) Implement FIFO behavior for 10-entry limit, 3) Create getHistory() and clearHistory() methods, 4) Integrate automatic history tracking with all calculator operations, 5) Comprehensive testing of history management edge cases",
			"reasoning": "Moderate-high complexity due to FIFO queue management, automatic integration with all operations, and state management concerns."

			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Create exportHistoryAsJson() method with proper JSON formatting, 2) Add metadata fields (timestamp, version, count) to export format, 3) Test export functionality with various history states and JSON parsing validation",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving JSON serialization and metadata handling. Relatively straightforward but requires careful format design."

		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement comprehensive error handling system",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize as: 1) Design and implement specific error types (InvalidInputError, DivisionByZeroError, InvalidOperationError), 2) Add contextual error messages with operation details, 3) Implement error recovery suggestions in messages, 4) Ensure consistent error handling across all public methods, 5) Add development mode stack traces and comprehensive error testing",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to comprehensive error taxonomy, contextual messaging, and integration across entire codebase. Requires careful design for maintainability."
